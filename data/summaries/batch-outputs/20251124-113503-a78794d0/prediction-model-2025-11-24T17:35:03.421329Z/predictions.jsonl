It provides the detailed procedures and substantive requirements for securing, maintaining, and enforcing rights in patents, trademarks, and copyrights. This essential title translates the broader statutory framework of intellectual property law into actionable regulations for inventors, artists, businesses, and legal practitioners.\n\n### Key Agencies Shaping Intellectual Property Regulation\n\nThe administration of Title 37 is a collaborative effort among several key federal agencies, each with a distinct area of focus:\n\n*   **United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO):** Operating under the Department of Commerce, the USPTO is the primary agency for patents and trademarks. Its regulations in Title 37 cover the entire lifecycle of these assets, from the initial application and examination to post-grant proceedings, maintenance, and the representation of others before the USPTO.\n*   **U.S. Copyright Office:** Housed within the Library of Congress, the Copyright Office is responsible for administering the copyright system. Its regulations detail the processes for registering copyright claims, recording documents, and other procedural matters related to copyright ownership and duration.\n*   **Copyright Royalty Board (CRB):** Also affiliated with the Library of Congress, the CRB is a panel of three administrative judges who determine royalty rates and terms for statutory licenses. This includes setting rates for cable and satellite retransmissions, as well as for webcasting and the use of musical works. Its procedures for royalty claims and rate-setting proceedings are outlined in Title 37.\n*   **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):** Another agency within the Department of Commerce, NIST's role in Title 37 is focused on the rights to inventions that arise from federally funded research and development. It administers the Bayh-Dole Act, which allows universities, small businesses, and non-profits to retain title to inventions made under federal grants and contracts, and also governs the licensing of government-owned inventions.\n\n### The Broad Scope of Title 37 Regulations\n\nTitle 37 is meticulously organized into chapters, each dedicated to the rules of a specific agency, covering a wide array of intellectual property matters:\n\n**Patents (Chapter I - USPTO):** The regulations for patents are extensive, detailing:\n*   The procedures for filing and prosecuting patent applications, including requirements for the specification, drawings, and inventor's oath.\n*   The examination process, including office actions, applicant replies, and appeals to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB).\n*   Rules for post-grant proceedings such as *inter partes* review (IPR), post-grant review (PGR), and *ex parte* reexamination.\n*   The maintenance of patents through the payment of fees.\n*   Regulations concerning the secrecy of certain inventions and the process for obtaining licenses to file patents in foreign countries.\n\n**Trademarks (Chapter I - USPTO):** For trademarks, the regulations specify:\n*   The requirements for filing a trademark application, including the different bases for filing (e.g., use in commerce, intent to use).\n*   The examination process, including the evaluation of potential conflicts with existing marks and other grounds for refusal.\n*   Procedures for post-registration maintenance, including filing declarations of use and applications for renewal.\n*   Rules of practice for trademark proceedings before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB).\n\n**Copyrights (Chapter II - U.S. Copyright Office & Chapter III - Copyright Royalty Board):** The copyright-related chapters govern:\n*   General provisions for copyright, including what is and is not subject to copyright protection.\n*   The process for registering a claim to copyright, including the deposit requirements for different types of works.\n*   The recordation of transfers of copyright ownership and other documents.\n*   The rules and procedures for the Copyright Claims Board, an alternative forum for resolving small copyright disputes.\n*   The proceedings of the Copyright Royalty Board for determining and distributing royalty fees collected under compulsory licenses.\n*   The protection of mask works (the layout of integrated circuits) and vessel designs.\n\n**Federally Funded Inventions (Chapter IV - NIST):** This chapter implements the Bayh-Dole Act and includes:\n*   The rights and obligations of contractors (non-profits and small businesses) who elect to retain title to inventions made with federal funding.\n*   The \"march-in\" rights of the government, which allow it to require the contractor to grant a license in certain circumstances.\n*   The licensing of inventions owned by the federal government.\n*   The uniform patent policy for rights in inventions made by government employees.\n\n### Recent Major Changes and Developments\n\nThe landscape of intellectual property is ever-evolving, and Title 37 is periodically updated to reflect new laws, court decisions, and policy shifts. Some of the most significant recent changes include:\n\n*   **Proposed Overhaul of PTAB's IPR Institution Rules:** In October 2025, the USPTO announced proposed rulemaking that would significantly amend the rules for instituting *inter partes* review (IPR) proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The proposed changes aim to reduce duplicative patent challenges by, for instance, requiring petitioners to stipulate not to raise certain invalidity arguments in other forums and restricting IPRs when a patent has already been upheld in a federal court or by the ITC. These proposals have generated considerable discussion as they could substantially impact litigation strategy for both patent owners and challengers.\n\n*   **Delayed Implementation of the Trademark Modernization Act (TMA):** The USPTO has indefinitely delayed the effective date of certain provisions of the TMA of 2020. These delayed rules relate to new, shorter response periods and extensions for post-registration filings, which were postponed to allow for necessary IT system upgrades and to give the public more time to prepare for the changes.\n\n*   **Revisions to Bayh-Dole Regulations:** In 2023, a final rule went into effect that made a number of revisions and technical corrections to the regulations governing federally funded inventions. These changes were aimed at streamlining processes, clarifying definitions, and updating procedures related to exercising march-in rights and the electronic filing of Bayh-Dole reporting.\n\n*   **Adjustments to Patent Rules and Fees:** The USPTO has implemented various rule changes in recent years, with effective dates throughout 2022 and 2023. These have included updates to the rules for representation before the USPTO, the transition to electronic patent grants, permanent electronic filing for patent term extension applications, and adjustments to patent fees."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"recent amendments to 37 CFR
