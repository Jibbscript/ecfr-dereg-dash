Primarily under the purview of the Department of the Interior, these regulations impact a wide array of activities, from resource extraction and conservation to recreation and Native American affairs. This comprehensive summary outlines the key agencies involved, the extensive scope of its regulations, and significant recent changes that are reshaping the landscape of public land management.\n\n### Key Agencies Shaping Public Land Policy\n\nTitle 43 is administered by several key federal agencies, each with a distinct role in managing public lands and resources:\n\n*   **Office of the Secretary of the Interior:** This office has overarching responsibility and issues regulations on a broad range of topics, including departmental procedures, hearings and appeals, the Freedom of Information Act, and the protection of archaeological and historical resources. Subtitle A of Title 43 is dedicated to the regulations set forth by the Secretary's office.\n\n*   **Bureau of Land Management (BLM):** As the steward of more public land than any other federal agency, the BLM's regulations are extensive. Found in Subtitle B, Chapter II, these rules cover land resource management, including land classification, sales, withdrawals, and exchanges; mineral and energy resource management, such as oil and gas leasing, mining claims, and renewable energy development; and various land uses like livestock grazing, recreation, and wild horse and burro management.\n\n*   **Bureau of Reclamation (BOR):** The BOR's regulations, located in Subtitle B, Chapter I, focus on water resource management. This includes the operation of federal water projects, such as dams and reservoirs, regulations for water conservation, and public conduct on Reclamation lands and waterbodies.\n\n*   **Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission:** This independent federal agency has a specific and localized scope, with its regulations found in Subtitle B, Chapter III. It is responsible for mitigating the environmental impacts of the Central Utah Project and other federal reclamation projects in Utah.\n\n### The Broad Scope of Title 43 Regulations\n\nCFR Title 43 is organized into two main subtitles, each addressing different facets of public land administration:\n\n**Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of the Interior:** This subtitle lays the administrative groundwork for the Department. It includes procedural rules for practicing before the department, processes for hearings and appeals, and regulations implementing cross-cutting laws like the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and the Freedom of Information Act. It also covers broader policy areas such as fish and wildlife policy, wilderness preservation, and natural resource damage assessments.\n\n**Subtitle B - Regulations Relating to Public Lands:** This is the larger of the two subtitles and is further divided into chapters for the different land-managing agencies. It contains the detailed regulations for the use and protection of public lands and resources. Key areas of regulation include:\n*   **Land and Resource Management:** This encompasses land surveys, withdrawals, and classifications, as well as the sale, lease, or other disposal of public lands.\n*   **Mineral and Energy Development:** Detailed rules govern the exploration, development, and production of locatable minerals (such as gold and silver), leasable minerals (like oil, gas, and coal), and geothermal resources.\n*   **Grazing Administration:** Regulations pertaining to livestock grazing on public lands, including permit issuance and management.\n*   **Recreation and Visitor Services:** This includes rules for recreational activities, permits for commercial recreation, and management of recreational sites.\n*   **Water Resource Management:** The Bureau of Reclamation's rules on the operation of its water projects and public use of its facilities fall under this category.\n*   **Native American and Alaska Native Affairs:** This includes regulations concerning Indian allotments, Alaska Native selections, and other issues related to land and resource rights.\n\n### Recent Major Changes and Developments\n\nThe regulatory landscape of Title 43 has seen significant activity in recent years, reflecting shifting priorities in public land management.\n\nA landmark change was the **BLM's Public Lands Rule**, finalized in April 2024. This rule aimed to put conservation on an equal footing with other land uses like grazing and energy development. Key provisions of the rule included:\n*   **Elevating Conservation:** It explicitly named \"conservation\" as a \"use\" within the BLM's multiple-use mandate under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA).\n*   **Restoration and Mitigation Leases:** The rule introduced a new tool allowing the BLM to issue leases for the purpose of restoring and protecting public lands.\n*   **Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACECs):** It revised regulations to prioritize the designation and protection of ACECs to conserve important ecological and cultural resources.\n\nHowever, the future of this rule is uncertain. In September 2025, the BLM proposed a **rescission of the Conservation and Landscape Health Rule**. The proposal argues that the 2024 rule adds unnecessary burdens to the BLM's decision-making and management processes. This back-and-forth highlights the ongoing debate over the appropriate balance between conservation and other uses on public lands.\n\nIn other recent developments, the **Bureau of Reclamation finalized a rule in November 2023** to update regulations concerning public conduct on its facilities, lands, and waterbodies. The changes were prompted by the need to address new technologies, such as drones, and to modernize rules around firearms and access. The updated regulations aim to provide more consistency with other federal and state laws and give local partners more flexibility in managing recreation sites."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"CFR Title 43 table of
