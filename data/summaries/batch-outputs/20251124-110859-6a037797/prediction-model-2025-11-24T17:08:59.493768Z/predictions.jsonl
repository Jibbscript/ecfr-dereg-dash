This vital section of federal law outlines the legal framework for the trading of securities and commodities, aiming to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. It is important to distinguish Title 17 of the CFR from Title 17 of the United States Code, which pertains to copyright law.\n\n---\n\n### **Agencies Involved**\n\nSeveral key federal agencies are responsible for implementing and enforcing the regulations outlined in Title 17 of the CFR:\n\n*   **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):** The SEC is the primary regulator of the securities industry. Its regulations are found in Chapter II of Title 17 and cover a vast array of activities, including the registration of securities, reporting by public companies, and the conduct of broker-dealers and investment advisers.\n*   **Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC):** The CFTC oversees the commodity futures and options markets. Its rules, located in Chapter I of Title 17, are designed to prevent fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices in these markets.\n*   **Department of the Treasury:** The Treasury Department's regulations in Chapter IV of Title 17 address government securities. This includes rules for government securities brokers and dealers.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office also operates a \"Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Program,\" which should not be confused with the regulations governing securities and commodities.\n\n---\n\n### **Scope of Regulations**\n\nTitle 17 of the CFR is extensive, with its regulations organized into several volumes and chapters. The scope of these regulations is broad, encompassing a wide range of financial activities and market participants.\n\n**Key areas of regulation include:**\n\n*   **General Regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act:** This includes rules on registration of market participants, trading standards, customer protection, and limits on the positions traders can hold.\n*   **Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934:** These foundational statutes, and their corresponding regulations in Title 17, govern the issuance of new securities and the trading of securities in the secondary market. This includes requirements for electronic filings (Regulation S-T) and forms prescribed under these acts.\n*   **Investigatory Proceedings and Enforcement:** The regulations detail the procedures for investigations conducted by the CFTC and SEC to determine if violations of the law have occurred.\n*   **Customer Protection and Privacy:** Specific rules are in place to safeguard customer funds and financial information, such as the Privacy of Consumer Financial Information rules under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and whistleblower rules to encourage reporting of wrongdoing.\n*   **Specialized Regulations:** Title 17 also includes a variety of more targeted rules, such as Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure), which prohibits selective disclosure of material nonpublic information, and regulations concerning credit risk retention.\n\n---\n\n### **Recent Major Changes**\n\nThe regulatory landscape under Title 17 is subject to ongoing updates and amendments in response to market developments and legislative action.\n\nIn a recent technical amendment, the SEC revised the Code of Federal Regulations to reflect a court's vacatur of the \"Repurchase Rule.\" This rule, adopted in May 2023, would have modernized and improved disclosure about an issuer's equity securities repurchases. The court's decision, effective December 19, 2023, reverted the rules and forms to their state prior to the Repurchase Rule's implementation.\n\nSeparately, but also under a \"Title 17\" designation, the Department of Energy's Clean Energy Financing Program has seen significant changes. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 amended the program, expanding its scope and introducing new financing categories. These new categories include support for projects that receive financial backing from a State Energy Financing Institution and for projects that reinvest in existing energy infrastructure. An interim final rule for the \"Energy Dominance Financing Amendments\" became effective on October 28, 2025, with a public comment period open until December 29, 2025."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"US Code of Federal Regulations Title 17
