This title is a critical component of administrative law, codifying the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by various executive departments and agencies of the U.S. Federal Government.\n\n**Agencies Involved:**\n\nThe enforcement and administration of Title 46 are primarily handled by three federal agencies, each with distinct responsibilities outlined in different chapters of the title:\n\n*   **United States Coast Guard (USCG):** As a branch of the Armed Forces and a federal regulatory agency, the Coast Guard is the principal enforcer of maritime safety and security regulations. Its authority under Title 46 is extensive, covering vessel inspections, marine casualty investigations, licensing and certification of maritime personnel, and manning requirements. The USCG's regulations are primarily found in Chapter I, which is the most voluminous and detailed section of Title 46, and Chapter III, which specifically addresses Great Lakes pilotage.\n*   **Maritime Administration (MARAD):** An agency within the Department of Transportation, MARAD is responsible for promoting the U.S. waterborne transportation system, including the merchant marine. Its regulations in Chapter II of Title 46 cover topics such as financial reporting requirements for vessels, procedures for reviewing actions by the Maritime Subsidy Board, and claims against the administration.\n*   **Federal Maritime Commission (FMC):** An independent agency, the FMC regulates oceanborne transportation in the foreign commerce of the U.S. Chapter IV of Title 46 contains FMC regulations, which include rules of practice and procedure, regulations for ocean transportation intermediaries, and oversight of service contracts and carrier agreements.\n\n**Scope of Regulations:**\n\nTitle 46 is extensive, covering a wide array of maritime activities to ensure safety, security, and environmental protection. The regulations are broadly categorized into several subchapters, each addressing a specific area of the shipping industry. Key areas of regulation include:\n\n*   **Vessel Safety and Inspection:** This includes standards for vessel design, construction, and equipment, as well as regular inspections to ensure compliance.\n*   **Personnel and Licensing:** Title 46 outlines the requirements for merchant mariner credentials, including licensing for officers and certification for seamen, as well as standards for chemical testing. The National Maritime Center (NMC) is the USCG's authority for issuing these credentials.\n*   **Vessel Operations:** This encompasses regulations on navigation, manning requirements, and procedures for handling specific types of cargo, such as hazardous materials.\n*   **Casualty and Investigation:** The regulations detail the procedures for investigating marine casualties and for taking personnel action following an incident.\n*   **Ocean Shipping and Commerce:** These rules govern the economic aspects of shipping, including tariffs, service contracts, and the financial responsibility of vessel operators.\n*   **Specialized Vessels:** There are specific parts of Title 46 dedicated to different types of vessels, such as tank vessels, passenger vessels, and commercial fishing industry vessels.\n\n**Recent Major Changes:**\n\nThe landscape of maritime regulation is continually evolving. A significant recent update to Title 46 involves a final rule issued by the U.S. Coast Guard, effective November 24, 2025, which introduces non-substantive technical, organizational, and conforming amendments to existing regulations.\n\nAnother notable recent development is the final rule on \"Updates to Marine Engineering Standards,\" which becomes effective September 10, 2024. This rule incorporates by reference updated industry standards for various vessel components, including boilers, pressure vessels, and piping systems. The aim is to align the regulations with current industry best practices and eliminate outdated requirements.\n\nFurthermore, a final rule effective April 3, 2024, made several technical and editorial corrections throughout Title 46 to improve clarity and accuracy. These periodic updates are part of the Coast Guard's ongoing effort to keep the regulations current and accessible to the public. While many of these changes are technical in nature, they are crucial for maintaining a clear and effective regulatory framework for the shipping industry."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"Federal Maritime Commission regulations in CFR Title
