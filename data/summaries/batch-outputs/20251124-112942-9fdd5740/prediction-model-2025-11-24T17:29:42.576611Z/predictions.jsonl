This critical set of regulations balances the economic imperatives of resource development with the paramount concerns of worker safety and environmental protection. Overseen by several key federal agencies, Title 30 extends its reach from the subterranean depths of underground coal mines to the expansive waters of the Outer Continental Shelf.\n\n### Key Agencies Shaping the Regulatory Landscape\n\nA constellation of federal bodies, primarily within the Departments of Labor and the Interior, is responsible for the administration and enforcement of Title 30's multifaceted regulations:\n\n*   **Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA):** Housed within the Department of Labor, MSHA is the primary agency responsible for the safety and health of the nation's miners. Its regulations, found in Chapter I of Title 30, encompass everything from training and equipment standards to emergency procedures in both coal and other types of mines.\n*   **Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE):** An agency of the Department of the Interior, BSEE is charged with ensuring the safe and environmentally responsible operation of offshore energy production, including oil, gas, and renewable energy projects on the Outer Continental Shelf.\n*   **Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM):** Also part of the Department of the Interior, BOEM manages the development of the nation's offshore resources. Its responsibilities include leasing, resource evaluation, and environmental studies.\n*   **Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE):** This Interior Department agency is tasked with regulating surface coal mining and ensuring the reclamation of mined lands to a state of beneficial use.\n*   **Geological Survey (USGS):** While not a primary regulatory body in the same vein as the others, the USGS, another Interior agency, contributes to the scientific understanding that underpins many of the regulations within Title 30.\n\n### A Broad and Varied Scope of Regulations\n\nThe regulations codified in Title 30 are extensive, addressing a wide array of activities and sectors within the mineral and energy industries. The scope of these rules includes, but is not limited to:\n\n*   **Mine Safety and Health:** Detailed standards for underground and surface mining operations, covering ventilation, roof support, electrical safety, and permissible equipment.\n*   **Surface Mining and Reclamation:** Regulations governing the environmental impacts of surface coal mining, including requirements for restoring the land to its approximate original contour and revegetating the area.\n*   **Offshore Energy Development:** A comprehensive framework for oil, gas, and sulfur drilling and production on the Outer Continental Shelf, with a strong emphasis on safety and oil spill response. This now also includes regulations for offshore renewable energy installations.\n*   **Mineral Leasing and Revenue:** Procedures for leasing public lands for mineral extraction and the collection of royalties and other revenues on behalf of the federal government.\n*   **Explosives and Blasting:** Specific requirements for the training, examination, and certification of individuals who handle explosives in surface coal mining operations.\n*   **Hazard Communication:** Mandates for operators to inform miners about the chemical hazards they may encounter in the workplace.\n\n### Recent and Proposed Changes in Regulation\n\nThe regulatory landscape of Title 30 is not static, with agencies regularly updating rules to adapt to new technologies, address emerging safety concerns, and improve efficiency.\n\nA significant recent change occurred in January 2023 with the reorganization of regulations pertaining to renewable energy and alternate uses of existing facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf. In a move to streamline oversight, the Department of the Interior transferred the responsibility for safety and environmental enforcement of these activities from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). This change was procedural and did not alter the substantive requirements of the regulations.\n\nLooking ahead, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has proposed a rule to revise its Hazard Communication (HazCom) standards. The proposed change would permit electronic access to all HazCom materials, aiming to reduce paperwork for mine operators while ensuring miners have ready access to crucial information about chemical hazards. This proposal is currently in the public comment phase."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"CFR Title 30 scope of
