While both are significant, they govern entirely different spheres of federal authority.\n\n---\n\n### **U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 18: Conservation of Power and Water Resources**\n\nAs per the user's specific request, this summary details Title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which codifies the general and permanent rules of federal agencies.\n\n**Agencies Involved:**\n\nA number of federal agencies issue and enforce regulations under CFR Title 18. The most prominent among them is the **Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)**, which falls under the Department of Energy. Other significant agencies with regulations in this title include:\n\n*   **Delaware River Basin Commission**\n*   **Susquehanna River Basin Commission**\n*   **Tennessee Valley Authority**\n*   **Water Resources Council**\n\n**Scope of Regulations:**\n\nCFR Title 18 is broadly focused on the economic and environmental regulation of energy and water resources. The regulations are extensive and are organized into several chapters, with the bulk of the rules issued by FERC. Key areas covered by the regulations include:\n\n*   **Federal Power Act Regulations:** This includes rules on the licensing of hydroelectric projects, the interconnection of electric facilities, and the transfer of licenses.\n*   **Interstate Commerce Act Regulations:** FERC's authority extends to setting rates and terms for oil pipeline tariffs.\n*   **Natural Gas Act and Natural Gas Policy Act Regulations:** These parts govern the sale and transportation of natural gas, including the construction and operation of pipelines.\n*   **Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) Regulations:** These rules encourage energy conservation and the development of small power production and cogeneration facilities.\n*   **Reliability of the Bulk-Power System:** This includes mandatory reliability standards for the nation's electricity grid.\n*   **River Basin Commission Regulations:** The regulations from the Delaware, Susquehanna, and other river basin commissions address water resource management, water quality, and project review within their specific geographic jurisdictions.\n*   **Tennessee Valley Authority:** This chapter outlines the standards of conduct for TVA employees and other procedural rules.\n\n**Recent Major Changes:**\n\nThe landscape of energy regulation is dynamic, and Title 18 reflects this with ongoing updates. Some recent notable changes include:\n\n*   **Sunsetting of Outdated Regulations:** In late 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a final rule to sunset 53 regulations it identified as outdated, seldom used, or duplicative. This action was taken in response to an executive order aimed at streamlining regulations. The sunset regulations include those related to phased electric rate increase filings, regional transmission groups that have been superseded, and certain reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines that are no longer necessary due to industry changes.\n*   **Removal of Construction Authorization Limitations:** In October 2025, FERC issued a final rule, effective November 10, 2025, to remove a regulation that had previously limited authorizations to proceed with construction activities for natural gas projects while a rehearing of their initial approval was pending. The stated purpose of this change was to remove barriers to the construction of necessary energy infrastructure.\n*   **Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation:** In 2024 and 2025, FERC has been actively working on major rules regarding regional transmission planning and cost allocation to build out the nation's electric grid for the future, as well as improving generator interconnection procedures.\n\nThe electronic version of the Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) for Title 18 is continuously updated, with the latest amendments noted as being made in October 2025.\n\n---\n\n### **U.S. Code Title 18: Federal Crimes and Criminal Procedure**\n\nOften what people refer to as \"Title 18\" is the main body of federal criminal law in the United States. It is a separate and distinct document from CFR Title 18.\n\n**Scope of Regulations:**\n\nFirst enacted in 1948, this title defines a wide array of federal crimes and outlines the procedures for the federal criminal justice system. It is organized into five parts:\n\n*   **Part I: Crimes:** This is the most extensive part, defining federal offenses across numerous chapters. Examples of crimes covered include:\n    *   Arson, Assault, and Homicide\n    *   Bribery, Graft, and Conflicts of Interest\n    *   Civil Rights violations\n    *   Computer Fraud and Abuse\n    *   Conspiracy\n    *   Counterfeiting and Forgery\n    *   Espionage and Terrorism\n    *   Firearms, Explosives, and Destructive Devices\n    *   Fraud and False Statements\n    *   Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act violations\n*   **Part II: Criminal Procedure:** This part details the legal process for federal criminal cases, including rules on arrest, search and seizure, grand juries, indictments, and sentencing.\n*   **Part III: Prisons and Prisoners:** This section governs the federal prison system, including the Bureau of Prisons, and rules regarding the custody and care of inmates.\n*   **Part IV: Correction of Youthful Offenders:** This part addresses the treatment of juvenile delinquents in the federal system.\n*   **Part V: Immunity of Witnesses:** Added in 1970, this part outlines the process for granting immunity to witnesses to compel their testimony.\n\n**Agencies Involved:**\n\nA wide range of federal law enforcement agencies are involved in enforcing the laws laid out in USC Title 18. The primary investigative agency for many of these federal crimes is the **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)**, which falls under the **Department of Justice (DOJ)**. Other key agencies include the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the U.S. Marshals Service, and the investigative arms of various other federal departments. Federal prosecutions are carried out by U.S. Attorneys' Offices across the country."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"overview
