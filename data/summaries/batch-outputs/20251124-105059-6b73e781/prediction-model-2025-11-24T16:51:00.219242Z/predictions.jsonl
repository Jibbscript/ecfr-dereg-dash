Primarily administered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), this title establishes the regulations governing the nation's efforts to prevent and respond to threats against the homeland. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) also plays a significant role in ensuring that these security measures are balanced with the protection of individual rights. The scope of Title 6 is broad, covering everything from immigration and border control to cybersecurity and the protection of critical infrastructure. Recent years have seen significant regulatory changes, particularly in the areas of asylum, temporary worker programs, and public charge inadmissibility.\n\n### Key Agencies Involved\n\nThe primary federal agency responsible for the regulations in Title 6 is the **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**. Established in the wake of the September 11th attacks, DHS oversees a wide range of security functions. Its regulations in Title 6 are implemented by various component agencies, including:\n\n*   **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)**, which is responsible for securing the nation's borders.\n*   **U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)**, which enforces immigration laws within the country.\n*   **U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)**, which administers the legal immigration system.\n*   **Transportation Security Administration (TSA)**, which is tasked with protecting the nation's transportation systems.\n*   **Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)**, which works to protect against and respond to cyber and physical threats to critical infrastructure.\n\nThe **Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB)** is an independent agency within the executive branch that provides advice and oversight to ensure that federal counterterrorism efforts are balanced with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties. The PCLOB reviews and analyzes actions taken by the executive branch to protect the nation from terrorism.\n\n### Scope of Regulations\n\nThe regulations within Title 6 are extensive and address a multitude of domestic security issues. Some of the key areas covered include:\n\n*   **Immigration and Border Security:** This is a significant portion of Title 6, with regulations governing asylum procedures, visa programs, and the enforcement of immigration laws.\n*   **Cybersecurity:** CISA's regulations aim to secure federal networks and critical infrastructure from cyber threats.\n*   **Critical Infrastructure Protection:** This includes regulations designed to protect essential assets, systems, and networks, from physical and cyber threats.\n*   **Transportation Security:** The TSA implements rules for aviation security, as well as for other modes of transportation.\n*   **REAL ID Act:** Title 6 includes regulations for the implementation of the REAL ID Act, which sets standards for state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards to be accepted for certain federal purposes.\n*   **Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS):** These regulations are designed to secure high-risk chemical facilities from terrorist attacks.\n*   **Protection of Privacy and Civil Liberties:** Regulations related to the PCLOB outline its functions and responsibilities in overseeing the privacy implications of domestic security programs.\n\n### Recent Major Changes and Developments\n\nIn recent years, several significant regulatory changes have been proposed and implemented under Title 6, reflecting the evolving landscape of domestic security threats and priorities.\n\n#### Asylum and Fear Screening Final Rule (2024)\n\nIn December 2024, DHS finalized a rule titled \"Application of Certain Mandatory Bars in Fear Screenings.\" This rule gives asylum officers the authority to apply certain mandatory bars to asylum and withholding of removal during the initial credible fear and reasonable fear screening process for individuals who pose a threat to national security or public safety. Previously, these bars could only be applied later in the adjudication process. The stated goal of this change is to more quickly identify and remove individuals who present a security risk, thereby enhancing border security.\n\n#### Modernization of H-2A and H-2B Temporary Worker Programs (2024)\n\nDHS also finalized a rule in late 2024 to modernize the H-2A (agricultural) and H-2B (non-agricultural) temporary worker programs. Effective January 17, 2025, the new regulations aim to strengthen worker protections, increase program integrity, and provide more flexibility for both workers and employers. Key changes include:\n*   **Enhanced Worker Protections:** The rule introduces \"whistleblower protection\" for H-2 workers and strengthens the prohibition on employers charging prohibited fees.\n*   **Increased Flexibility:** The regulations provide for grace periods for workers to seek new employment if their jobs end prematurely and allow for \"portability,\" enabling workers to begin a new job with a new employer upon the filing of a petition, rather than waiting for approval.\n*   **Improved Efficiency:** The rule eliminates the requirement for USCIS to only approve petitions for nationals of countries on a designated list, and simplifies the process for resetting the three-year maximum period of stay.\n\n#### Proposed Changes to the Public Charge Rule (2025)\n\nIn November 2025, DHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2022 public charge regulation. The \"public charge\" ground of inadmissibility can lead to the denial of a green card or admission to the U.S. for individuals deemed likely to become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. The 2022 rule had narrowed the scope of benefits considered in this determination, excluding most non-cash benefits like Medicaid and nutrition assistance. The new proposal seeks to give immigration officers broader discretion in making public charge determinations, potentially expanding the range of public benefits that could be considered. This proposal is not yet in effect and is subject to a public comment period before a final rule is issued.\n\n#### Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) and the EU-US Data Privacy Framework\n\nRecent developments surrounding the PCLOB have drawn attention to its role in overseeing U.S. surveillance activities and its impact on international data sharing agreements. In early 2025, the dismissal of several board members left the PCLOB without a quorum, raising concerns about its ability to function effectively. This has had significant implications for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, an agreement that relies on the PCLOB's oversight to ensure that U.S. intelligence practices align with EU data protection standards. While the European Commission has stated that the framework remains in place, the situation has led to increased scrutiny and legal challenges. The PCLOB has also been active in examining the privacy implications of new technologies, holding public forums on the use of artificial intelligence in counterterrorism."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"DHS public charge rule 2024
