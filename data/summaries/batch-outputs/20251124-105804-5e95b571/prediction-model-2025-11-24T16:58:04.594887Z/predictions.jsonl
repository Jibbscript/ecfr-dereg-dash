These regulations are primarily administered and enforced by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), an independent regulatory agency established in 1975. The FEC's mandate is to ensure the integrity of the federal campaign finance process by providing transparency and administering and enforcing federal campaign finance laws.\n\nIt is important to distinguish Title 11 of the CFR from Title 11 of the United States Code (U.S.C.), which is the federal Bankruptcy Code. While both are federal laws, the CFR contains regulations issued by federal agencies, whereas the U.S.C. is a codification of statutes passed by Congress. There is also frequent confusion between CFR Title 11 and **Title 21 CFR Part 11**. The latter pertains to electronic records and signatures and is enforced by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the life sciences industry, a completely separate area of regulation.\n\n#### **Agencies Involved**\n\nThe primary agency associated with Title 11 is the **Federal Election Commission (FEC)**. The FEC is responsible for:\n*   Administering and enforcing the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA).\n*   Disclosing campaign finance information.\n*   Enforcing limitations and prohibitions on contributions and expenditures.\n*   Overseeing the public funding of Presidential elections.\n\nChapter II of Title 11 also outlines regulations related to the **Election Assistance Commission (EAC)**, which was established by the Help America Vote Act of 2002. The EAC serves as a national clearinghouse and resource for information on election administration and certifies voting systems.\n\n#### **Scope of Regulations**\n\nTitle 11 provides a detailed legal framework for the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House, Senate, and the Presidency. Its scope is broad, covering various aspects of the federal election process to ensure fairness and transparency. Key areas of regulation include:\n\n*   **Campaign Finance:** This includes rules on contributions and expenditures, detailing legal contribution limits and the permissible ways campaign funds can be used.\n*   **Political Action Committees (PACs):** The regulations detail the formation, operation, and financial activities of PACs.\n*   **Disclosure and Reporting:** Political committees are required to file periodic reports of their receipts and disbursements, which are made available to the public. These reports must list the name, address, occupation, and employer for each individual who contributes more than $200 in an election cycle.\n*   **Candidate and Political Party Rules:** Title 11 outlines specific guidelines that candidates and political parties must adhere to during their campaigns.\n*   **Public Communications:** This includes regulations on disclaimers that must appear on certain public communications, such as television, radio, and print advertisements, to identify who paid for the message.\n\n#### **Recent Major Changes**\n\nA significant recent update to Title 11 is the **Technological Modernization rule**, which took effect in early 2024. This rule was implemented to address advances in technology and how they impact federal elections. The key changes include:\n\n*   **Modernizing Electronic Transactions:** The rule updates regulations to clarify how contributions made via credit cards, text messages, and internet-based payment processors are to be handled.\n*   **Facilitating Electronic Processes:** It facilitates electronic accounting, recordkeeping, reporting, and the redesignation of contributions by political committees.\n*   **Updating Outmoded References:** The revisions also eliminate or update references to outdated technologies, bringing the regulations in line with current practices.\n\nThese changes are intended to provide clarity for political committees and ensure that the FEC's regulations are keeping pace with the evolving landscape of digital communication and finance. To stay current with any amendments, the FEC advises consulting the Federal Register and the \"List of CFR Sections Affected\" (LSA), which are updated monthly."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"US Code of Federal Regulations Title 11 Federal
