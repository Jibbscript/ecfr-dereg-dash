It serves as the regulatory backbone for implementing the nation's key environmental laws. This summary provides an overview of the agencies involved, the extensive scope of its regulations, and significant recent and proposed changes.\n\n### Key Agencies Involved\n\nThe administration and enforcement of Title 40 involve several key federal agencies:\n\n*   **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):** The EPA is the primary agency responsible for writing and enforcing the regulations within Title 40. Congress has granted the EPA the authority to develop regulations that translate the broad mandates of environmental laws into specific, legally enforceable requirements for individuals, businesses, and government entities.\n\n*   **Department of Justice (DOJ):** The DOJ provides legal counsel and representation for the federal government in matters arising from environmental regulations. It handles litigation related to the enforcement of environmental laws and can intervene in administrative proceedings that may affect civil or criminal cases.\n\n*   **Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ):** The CEQ is situated within the Executive Office of the President and is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). It develops and recommends national environmental policies to the President and, until recently, issued the implementing regulations for NEPA, which are found in Title 40.\n\n*   **Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB):** The CSB is an independent federal agency tasked with investigating industrial chemical accidents. It issues safety recommendations to the EPA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and other private and public organizations to prevent future incidents.\n\n*   **Department of Defense (DoD):** The DoD is responsible for ensuring compliance with environmental regulations on its facilities and vessels. This includes managing releases of hazardous substances and adhering to standards for waste disposal and pollution control.\n\n### Scope of Regulations\n\nTitle 40 is organized into numerous subchapters and parts that cover a wide array of environmental topics. The regulations are largely based on major environmental statutes passed by Congress. Key areas of regulation include:\n\n*   **Air Programs (Subchapter C):** These regulations implement the Clean Air Act and establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for common pollutants like ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. This subchapter also includes standards for hazardous air pollutants, new source performance standards, and operating permit programs.\n\n*   **Water Programs (Subchapters D and N):** Based on the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, these regulations cover a broad spectrum of water-related issues. This includes setting effluent limitation guidelines for industrial discharges, establishing water quality standards for surface waters, regulating the discharge of dredged or fill material, and ensuring the safety of public drinking water supplies.\n\n*   **Solid Wastes (Subchapter I):** These regulations implement the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and govern the management of solid and hazardous waste. They establish a \"cradle-to-grave\" system for hazardous waste, from generation and transportation to treatment, storage, and disposal. This subchapter also includes standards for municipal solid waste landfills and underground storage tanks.\n\n*   **Pesticide Programs (Subchapter E):** This section includes regulations for the registration, sale, and use of pesticides to protect human health and the environment.\n\n*   **Radiation Protection Programs (Subchapter F):** These regulations establish standards for the management and disposal of radioactive wastes.\n\n*   **Other Areas:** Title 40 also addresses ocean dumping, noise abatement programs, and the community's right-to-know about hazardous chemicals under the Superfund program.\n\n### Recent and Proposed Major Changes\n\nTitle 40 is a dynamic body of regulation, with ongoing updates and proposed revisions. As of late 2025, several significant changes and proposals are noteworthy:\n\n*   **Rollback of Environmental Regulations:** In a significant policy shift, the EPA has announced plans to review and potentially revise 31 major environmental regulations, including those related to air and water quality, as well as climate-warming emissions. This initiative is aimed at reducing regulatory burdens and lowering energy costs, but has raised concerns among public health experts about potential increases in pollution. One of the most significant moves is the proposed overturning of the 2009 \"endangerment finding,\" which is the legal foundation for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.\n\n*   **\"Waters of the United States\" (WOTUS) Definition:** Following a 2023 Supreme Court decision in *Sackett v. EPA*, the EPA has proposed revisions to the definition of WOTUS, which determines the scope of federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. The proposed changes would narrow the definition to cover only relatively permanent, standing, or continuously flowing bodies of water and wetlands with a direct connection to them, potentially reducing protections for many wetlands and ephemeral streams.\n\n*   **Regulation of PFAS:** In February 2024, the EPA proposed two new rules under RCRA to address per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). One proposal would list nine specific PFAS compounds as hazardous constituents, allowing the EPA to address their release from hazardous waste facilities. The other proposal seeks to amend the definition of \"hazardous waste\" for corrective actions, clarifying the EPA's authority to clean up a broader range of substances, including emerging contaminants like PFAS. Additionally, a proposed revision to the TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule would add exemptions and shorten the reporting timeline.\n\n*   **New Vehicle Emission Standards:** In March 2024, the EPA finalized new, more stringent emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles for model years 2027 through 2032. While described as technology-neutral, the standards are expected to drive an increase in the use of zero-emission vehicle technologies. The agency also finalized multi-pollutant emissions standards for light-duty and medium-duty vehicles for model years 2027 and later.\n\n*   **Oil and Gas Sector Emissions:** In March 2024, the EPA released comprehensive new regulations (Subpart OOOOb/c) targeting methane and other emissions from new and existing oil and gas facilities. These rules mandate stricter standards for equipment like process controllers and pneumatic pumps and require the capture or control of associated gas from new wells. However, compliance deadlines for certain monitoring requirements have been extended due to supply chain and personnel limitations.\n\n*   **Endangered Species Act Revisions:** The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed rules to revise regulations under the Endangered Species Act, aiming to provide more regulatory certainty and reduce burdens. These changes would affect listing and critical habitat designations, interagency cooperation, and protections for threatened species.\n\nThese recent and proposed changes reflect a complex and evolving regulatory landscape, with significant implications for environmental protection and economic activity in the United States. Proposed rules are subject to public comment and may be finalized, modified, or withdrawn."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"major proposed changes to US environmental
