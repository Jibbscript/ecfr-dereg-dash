This title primarily contains the rules and regulations issued by federal agencies that provide financial assistance, procurement opportunities, and developmental aid to businesses, with a strong emphasis on small and disadvantaged enterprises.\n\n**Agencies Involved and Scope of Regulations:**\n\nSeveral key federal agencies have their regulations codified in Title 13, each with a distinct focus:\n\n*   **Small Business Administration (SBA):** The SBA is the most prominent agency within Title 13, with its regulations spanning a vast portion of the title. The SBA's rules cover a broad spectrum of business support, including:\n    *   **Small Business Size Regulations (13 CFR Part 121):** These regulations define what constitutes a small business for the purpose of federal assistance programs. The SBA establishes size standards, typically based on the number of employees or average annual receipts, which vary by industry as defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).\n    *   **Affiliation Rules (13 CFR 121.103):** The SBA's affiliation rules are crucial in determining a business's size by considering its relationships with other entities. Affiliation exists when one business controls or has the power to control another, and the SBA considers factors like ownership, management, and contractual relationships to make this determination.\n    *   **Loan Programs:** Title 13 details the regulations for various SBA loan programs, including the 7(a) Loan Program, 504 Loan Program, Microloan Program, and disaster loans, which provide critical capital to small businesses.\n    *   **Government Contracting and Business Development Programs (13 CFR Parts 124, 125, 126, 127):** A significant portion of the SBA's regulations in Title 13 is dedicated to programs that help small businesses compete for federal contracts. This includes the 8(a) Business Development program for socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) program, the Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contract Program, and programs for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.\n\n*   **Economic Development Administration (EDA):** A bureau within the Department of Commerce, the EDA's regulations in Title 13 focus on providing grants and technical assistance to communities to generate new jobs, retain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas. Its regulations cover:\n    *   **Public Works and Economic Development Investments:** Rules for financial assistance for the construction of public facilities that promote economic development.\n    *   **Planning and Technical Assistance:** Regulations for grants that help create economic development plans and provide technical assistance to businesses.\n    *   **Economic Adjustment Assistance:** Rules governing assistance to help communities adjust to sudden and severe economic changes.\n\n*   **Emergency Steel Guarantee Loan Board and Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Board:** These boards were established to provide loan guarantees to qualified steel and oil and gas companies, respectively, facing financial difficulties. Their regulations are found in 13 CFR Parts 400 and 500. Given the dates of their enabling legislation, these programs were created to address specific historical economic challenges in those industries.\n\n**Recent Major Changes:**\n\nTitle 13 is a dynamic area of regulation, with the SBA in particular frequently updating its rules to adapt to the evolving needs of the business community and to improve program efficiency. Recent and proposed changes of significance include:\n\n*   **HUBZone Program Modernization:** In a final rule published in late 2024 and effective in January 2025, the SBA implemented comprehensive reforms to the HUBZone program. Key changes include:\n    *   Requiring firms to be eligible on the date they submit an offer for a HUBZone contract.\n    *   Shifting from an annual recertification requirement to a triennial (every three years) recertification, reducing the administrative burden on participating firms.\n    *   Clarifying the definition of a HUBZone \"employee\" and the requirements for a firm's principal office. A corrective amendment was issued in June 2025 to clarify the \"legacy\" HUBZone employee rule, addressing confusion that arose from the transition to triennial recertification.\n\n*   **Proposed Changes to Affiliation and Other Small Business Programs:** In August 2024, the SBA issued a proposed rule with potentially significant impacts on its affiliation rules and other programs. The proposed changes aim to bring more clarity and consistency across different programs. Notably, the proposal seeks to explicitly define what constitutes \"negative control\" by a minority shareholder, which can trigger affiliation. The aim is to allow small businesses to attract equity investment without inadvertently jeopardizing their small business status.\n\n*   **Proposed Amendments to Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Regulations:** The SBA has proposed amendments to its SBIC regulations, which are designed to modernize the program and remove obsolete provisions. These proposals include removing definitions and regulations related to outdated forms of leverage that are no longer in use.\n\n*   **Streamlining of SBA Loan Programs:** In late 2022, the SBA proposed rules to streamline and simplify its 7(a) and 504 loan programs. These changes aim to modernize regulations on the use of loan proceeds, lending criteria, and reconsiderations of denied loans.\n\nThese recent and proposed changes reflect an ongoing effort by the agencies governed by Title 13, particularly the SBA, to refine their regulations to better serve the American business community, reduce administrative burdens, and enhance the effectiveness of federal business assistance and development programs. The electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) provides the most up-to-date version of these rules, with the last amendment to Title 13 noted as of July 3, 2025."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"CFR Title 13 Small Business Administration recent
