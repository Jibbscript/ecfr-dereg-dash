It governs the employment relationship between federal employees and the government, from hiring to retirement. This title works in conjunction with Title 5 of the United States Code, \"Government Organization and Employees,\" which provides the statutory basis for these regulations.\n\n#### **Agencies Involved**\n\nA wide array of federal agencies issue regulations that are codified in Title 5 of the CFR. While many departments and commissions have specific rules pertaining to their own personnel, the most prominent agency is the **Office of Personnel Management (OPM)**.\n\nOther significant agencies with regulations in Title 5 include:\n*   **Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)**, which adjudicates appeals of federal personnel actions.\n*   **Office of Government Ethics (OGE)**, which provides overall leadership and oversight of the executive branch ethics program.\n*   **Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA)**, which oversees the labor-management relations program for federal employees.\n*   **Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB)**, which administers the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).\n\nIn addition, numerous other executive departments and agencies have specific chapters or parts within Title 5 that address supplemental standards of ethical conduct for their employees or other agency-specific personnel matters. These include the Departments of Justice, Defense, Homeland Security, and Treasury, among many others.\n\n#### **Scope of Regulations**\n\nTitle 5 is extensive and covers a broad spectrum of federal employment matters. The regulations are organized into several parts, each addressing a specific aspect of personnel management. Key areas of regulation include:\n\n*   **Employment and Retention**: This includes regulations on competitive service appointments, career and career-conditional employment, temporary and term employment, and reduction in force procedures.\n*   **Pay and Allowances**: This section governs pay administration under various systems, including the General Schedule, as well as recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives.\n*   **Attendance and Leave**: These regulations stipulate hours of duty, and policies on annual and sick leave.\n*   **Employee Performance and Development**: This covers performance management, training programs, and executive development.\n*   **Labor-Management and Employee Relations**: This area includes the rules governing labor organizations, unfair labor practices, and negotiability proceedings.\n*   **Insurance and Annuities**: This pertains to the federal employee health benefits program, life insurance, and the civil service retirement system.\n*   **Ethics and Conduct**: The Office of Government Ethics' regulations on standards of ethical conduct, financial disclosure, and post-employment restrictions are a significant part of this title.\n*   **Suitability and Vetting**: These regulations establish the standards and procedures for background investigations to determine an individual's suitability for federal employment.\n\n#### **Recent Major Changes**\n\nTitle 5 of the CFR is subject to updates as the executive branch issues new rules and policies. Some of the recent significant changes include:\n\n*   **Safeguarding the Civil Service:** In April 2024, the Office of Personnel Management issued a final rule aimed at protecting federal employees from being reclassified as at-will workers. This rule clarifies that civil service protections cannot be removed through an involuntary move from the competitive service to the excepted service and establishes an appeals process with the Merit Systems Protection Board for such actions. This rule was a response to the proposed \"Schedule F\" policy from a prior administration. There have been subsequent executive orders aiming to reinstate the \"Schedule F\" policy and rescind the 2024 rule.\n*   **Strengthening Probationary Periods:** A final rule effective in June 2025 rescinds previous regulations on probationary periods for new employees in the competitive service. This change, prompted by an executive order, is intended to reinforce the probationary period as a final step in the hiring process and removes certain barriers for agencies in making decisions about continued employment.\n*   **Personnel Vetting and Continuous Vetting:** A final rule effective in January 2025 revises the regulations for personnel vetting for suitability and fitness for federal employment. This rule expands the requirements for background investigations to include not only competitive service appointments but also excepted service, contractor employees, and certain other positions. A key component of this rule is the implementation of continuous vetting for all risk levels of federal employees.\n*   **Fair Labor Standards Act Updates:** The Department of Labor issued a final rule in April 2024 to update the salary thresholds for executive, administrative, and professional employees to be exempt from minimum wage and overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act. However, a federal court vacated this rule in November 2024, and the matter is currently subject to further litigation. The Department of Labor also issued a final rule in January 2024, effective March 2024, on how to determine employee or independent contractor classification."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"what are the main parts of US Code of Federal Regulations Title
