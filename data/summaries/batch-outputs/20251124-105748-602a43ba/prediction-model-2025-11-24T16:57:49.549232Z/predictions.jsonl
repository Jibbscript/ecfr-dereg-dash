It also encompasses regulations related to energy conservation, renewable energy, and the nation's overall energy policy. The enforcement and maintenance of this title are primarily handled by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Department of Energy (DOE), with involvement from other smaller agencies.\n\n### Agencies Involved\n\nThe primary regulatory bodies overseeing the implementation of Title 10 are:\n\n*   **Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC):** The NRC is responsible for regulating the nation's civilian use of nuclear materials to protect public health and safety, promote the common defense and security, and protect the environment. Its regulations are codified in **Chapter I, Parts 1-199** of Title 10.\n*   **Department of Energy (DOE):** The DOE has a broader and more diverse mandate that includes the nation's nuclear weapons program, nuclear-related national security, energy conservation, renewable energy technologies, and the transfer of nuclear technology. The DOE's regulations are found in **Chapters II, III, and X, Parts 200-1299** of Title 10.\n*   **Other Agencies:** Several other federal bodies have specific and limited roles within Title 10, including the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, and the Northeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Commission.\n\n### Scope of Regulations\n\nThe scope of Title 10 is extensive and can be best understood by the division of responsibilities between the NRC and the DOE.\n\n**Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Scope (Parts 1-199):**\n\nThe NRC's regulations establish the requirements for all individuals and entities that hold an NRC license to use nuclear materials or operate nuclear facilities. Key areas of regulation include:\n\n*   **Licensing and Regulation:** This includes the design, construction, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants, research and test reactors, and other nuclear facilities.\n*   **Nuclear Materials:** The NRC governs the transportation, storage, and use of nuclear materials for medical, industrial, and academic purposes.\n*   **Safety and Security:** Regulations cover standards for protection against radiation, fitness-for-duty programs for nuclear plant workers, and the physical protection of nuclear materials and facilities.\n*   **Waste Management:** This involves rules for the disposal of radioactive waste.\n*   **Administrative Procedures:** This includes rules of practice and procedure for NRC proceedings, public records, and advisory committees.\n\n**Department of Energy (DOE) Scope (Parts 200-1299):**\n\nThe DOE's regulations under Title 10 cover a more diverse range of energy-related topics:\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** This includes energy efficiency standards for a variety of consumer products and commercial equipment, as well as for new federal buildings.\n*   **Nuclear Technology Transfers:** Part 810 of Title 10 specifically governs the transfer of unclassified nuclear technology and assistance to foreign entities, requiring authorization from the Secretary of Energy.\n*   **Oil and Gas:** The DOE regulates aspects of the oil and natural gas industries.\n*   **Renewable Energy:** The regulations include programs to incentivize and manage renewable energy facilities.\n*   **National Security:** The DOE is responsible for regulations concerning the security of its own facilities and the safeguarding of national security information and restricted data.\n\n### Recent Major Changes and Proposed Rules\n\nTitle 10 is subject to ongoing updates and amendments to address technological advancements, evolving energy policies, and administrative improvements.\n\n**Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC):**\n\n*   **Advanced Reactor Licensing (Part 53):** In response to the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (NEIMA), the NRC is developing a new, risk-informed, technology-inclusive licensing pathway for advanced nuclear reactors. A proposed rule for Part 53 was issued in late 2024, which aims to provide a more flexible and efficient regulatory framework for new reactor designs.\n*   **Fusion Energy Systems Regulation:** The NRC has begun developing a regulatory framework for fusion energy systems. In 2023, the agency issued preliminary proposed rule language to amend Parts 20, 30, and 51 to regulate fusion systems under its existing framework for byproduct materials.\n*   **Administrative Rule Changes:** In August 2024, the NRC issued a direct final rule, effective November 2024, to amend its \"Agency Rules of Practice and Procedure\" in 10 CFR Part 2. These changes are intended to improve the efficiency of adjudicatory proceedings and update the rules to reflect current agency practices and technological advances, such as improving the e-filing system.\n\n**Department of Energy (DOE):**\n\n*   **Stay on Fossil Fuel Reduction in Federal Buildings:** In May 2025, the DOE stayed for one year the compliance deadlines for 2024 rules that required new and renovated federal buildings to reduce their use of fossil fuels. This stay, impacting parts 433 and 435, is intended to allow for a review of the provisions.\n*   **Energy Conservation Standards:** The DOE frequently updates energy conservation standards for a wide array of consumer and commercial products. Recent and ongoing updates have included test procedures and standards for products such as automatic commercial ice makers, portable air conditioners, and uninterruptible power supplies.\n*   **Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorizations (CITAP):** The DOE has established the CITAP Program under Part 900 to streamline the federal authorization process for siting new electric transmission facilities, aiming to create a more efficient and coordinated review process.\n*   **Civil Penalties for Nuclear Technology Transfers:** In late 2022, the DOE finalized a rule establishing procedures for imposing civil penalties for violations of Part 810, which governs the transfer of unclassified nuclear technology to foreign entities. This rule was implemented to enforce provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"recent major rules CFR Title 10
