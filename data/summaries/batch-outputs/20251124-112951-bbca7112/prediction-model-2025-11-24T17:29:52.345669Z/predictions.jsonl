It provides the framework for the operations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and its various bureaus, impacting a wide range of financial activities both domestically and internationally.\n\n#### **Involved Agencies**\n\nThe primary agency overseeing Title 31 is the **U.S. Department of the Treasury**. Several of its key bureaus and offices are responsible for specific sections of the regulations:\n\n*   **Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN):** FinCEN is at the forefront of combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. It administers the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and has broad authority to issue regulations affecting financial institutions.\n*   **Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC):** OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals. Its regulations impact transactions with designated foreign countries, entities, and individuals.\n*   **Fiscal Service:** This bureau manages the federal government's finances, including collecting revenue, disbursing payments, and managing public debt.\n*   **Internal Revenue Service (IRS):** While the IRS has its own title in the CFR (Title 26), regulations concerning practice before the IRS are found in Title 31.\n*   **Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC):** The OCC supervises all national banks and federal savings associations.\n*   **Office of Investment Security:** This office implements regulations related to foreign investment in the United States and, more recently, outbound investments in certain national security-related sectors.\n*   **Bureau of Engraving and Printing** and **United States Mint:** These bureaus are responsible for the design and production of U.S. currency and coins.\n\n#### **Scope of Regulations**\n\nTitle 31 is organized into two main subtitles, each covering distinct regulatory areas:\n\n**Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of the Treasury:** This subtitle lays out the general and administrative provisions for the Department of the Treasury. Key parts include:\n*   **Part 1:** Regulations on the disclosure of records and the Right to Financial Privacy Act.\n*   **Part 10:** Rules governing practice before the Internal Revenue Service, outlining the duties and restrictions for attorneys, CPAs, and other tax professionals.\n*   **Parts 2 and 9:** Regulations concerning national security, including the handling of classified information and the effects of imported articles on national security.\n*   **Parts 5 and 285:** Rules related to Treasury debt collection and authorities under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996.\n*   **Sanctions Regulations:** A significant portion of this subtitle is dedicated to the regulations administered by OFAC, with specific parts for different sanctions programs (e.g., against countries, individuals, or activities like terrorism and narcotics trafficking).\n\n**Subtitle B - Regulations Relating to Money and Finance:** This subtitle is further divided into chapters, each corresponding to a specific Treasury bureau or function. Notable chapters and their scope include:\n*   **Chapter II - Fiscal Service:** Covers regulations on U.S. securities, the management of federal agency receipts and disbursements, and participation in the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network.\n*   **Chapter V - Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC):** Contains the extensive and frequently updated sanctions lists and associated regulations.\n*   **Chapter VIII - Office of Investment Security:** Includes regulations for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and, as of recent changes, rules governing outbound investments.\n*   **Chapter X - Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN):** This chapter implements the Bank Secrecy Act and contains crucial anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) regulations. This includes requirements for various financial institutions to establish AML programs, file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), and report large currency transactions.\n\n#### **Recent Major Changes**\n\nTitle 31 has seen significant updates in recent years, reflecting a growing focus on financial transparency, national security, and combating illicit financial activities.\n\n*   **Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting:** A major development stemming from the Corporate Transparency Act is the requirement for many domestic and foreign entities to report information about their beneficial owners to FinCEN. However, in a significant recent update, all entities created in the United States and their beneficial owners are now exempt from this reporting requirement as of March 26, 2025. Existing foreign companies that must report have an extended deadline.\n\n*   **Anti-Money Laundering Regulations for Investment Advisers:** In 2024, FinCEN issued a final rule extending AML/CFT obligations to certain registered investment advisers (RIAs) and exempt reporting advisers (ERAs), classifying them as \"financial institutions\" under the Bank Secrecy Act. This rule requires them to implement AML/CFT programs and file SARs. The compliance date for these new rules has been proposed to be pushed back to January 1, 2028, to allow more time for implementation and reassessment of the rules' impact.\n\n*   **Regulation of Outbound Investments:** In a significant expansion of its authority, the Treasury Department, through the Office of Investment Security, issued final regulations (31 CFR Part 850) effective January 2, 2025, to monitor and in some cases prohibit certain U.S. investments in \"countries of concern\" (currently China, Hong Kong, and Macau). These \"Reverse CFIUS\" regulations target investments in sensitive technology sectors, including semiconductors, quantum information technologies, and artificial intelligence.\n\n*   **Amendments to Sanctions Procedures:** In 2024, the 21st Century Peace Through Strength Act increased the statute of limitations for sanctions violations. Additionally, OFAC issued an interim final rule amending its reporting and penalties regulations, which took effect in August 2024.\n\n*   **International Criminal Court-Related Sanctions:** In July 2025, OFAC issued new regulations (31 CFR part 528) to implement an Executive Order related to the International Criminal Court, incorporating several general licenses into the formal regulations.\n\n*   **Updated Guidance on Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs):** In October 2025, FinCEN and other federal financial regulators jointly issued updated FAQs to clarify the requirements for filing SARs, particularly concerning structuring and continuing suspicious activity. This guidance aims to reduce defensive filing and focus on more valuable intelligence for law enforcement."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"31 CFR subtitles and their
