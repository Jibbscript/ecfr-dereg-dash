It governs a wide array of activities and management practices on federally owned lands and waters, from national parks and forests to monuments and historic sites. A diverse group of federal agencies is responsible for these regulations, which are periodically updated to address contemporary issues and streamline governance.\n\n### Scope of Regulations: From Park Benches to Historic Preservation\n\nThe regulations within Title 36 are extensive, covering nearly every aspect of public land management. This includes rules for visitor conduct, protection of natural and cultural resources, commercial operations, and the use of vehicles. The scope also extends to the management of specific areas and activities, such as boating, camping, hunting and fishing, and even the use of official symbols like the National Park Service's arrowhead. Furthermore, Title 36 incorporates crucial regulations concerning historic preservation and accessibility standards for individuals with disabilities on federal properties.\n\n### Key Agencies Shaping Public Land Policy\n\nA multitude of federal agencies contribute to and enforce the regulations outlined in Title 36. The most prominent among these are:\n\n*   **National Park Service (NPS):** Oversees the vast network of national parks, monuments, and historic sites.\n*   **U.S. Forest Service (USFS):** Manages the nation's national forests and grasslands.\n*   **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE):** Regulates public use of its water resource development projects.\n\nOther significant agencies involved include:\n\n*   **Smithsonian Institution**\n*   **Library of Congress**\n*   **National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)**\n*   **Advisory Council on Historic Preservation**\n*   **Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board**\n*   **American Battle Monuments Commission**\n*   **The Presidio Trust**\n\n### Recent and Proposed Changes to Title 36\n\nIn recent years, several key agencies have initiated or proposed significant changes to their regulations within Title 36, reflecting evolving priorities and the need for modernization.\n\nA notable, though ultimately withdrawn, proposal came from the **U.S. Forest Service (USFS)** in 2024. The agency had put forward a plan to amend all 128 of its land management plans to better protect old-growth forests. This would have involved new management approaches, standards, and monitoring requirements. However, after receiving extensive public comment, the USFS withdrew the notice of intent to prepare a National Old-Growth Amendment in January 2025, opting to focus on other forest health and wildfire resilience strategies. The USFS has also proposed rule changes aimed at incorporating state traffic laws into federal regulations for National Forest System lands, enhancing wildfire prevention measures, and updating prohibitions on controlled substances and disorderly conduct.\n\nThe **National Park Service (NPS)** has also seen recent policy adjustments. In early 2024, the NPS altered its \"America the Beautiful\" annual pass, reducing the number of signature lines from two to one. This change, intended to standardize pass usage, has been a topic of public discussion, particularly for families and frequent visitors who previously shared passes. Additionally, in a move to streamline processes, the NPS announced in June 2025 the adoption of 33 categorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This will allow the agency to bypass lengthy environmental reviews for routine actions that do not have significant environmental impacts, such as infrastructure upgrades and certain resource management activities.\n\nThe **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)** has taken steps to modernize its permitting and regulatory processes. In February 2024, the USACE proposed revisions to its historic preservation rules to better align them with the National Historic Preservation Act, a move intended to reduce confusion and standardize consultation processes. Furthermore, the agency has launched a new national online platform, the Regulatory Request System (RRS), which became available for electronic permit submissions in May 2024, aiming to streamline the application process. The USACE has also solicited public comment on proposed changes to the National Wetland Plant List.\n\nThese recent activities highlight the dynamic nature of federal land management as agencies adapt to new challenges and seek to improve efficiency and public service. The ongoing updates to Title 36 are publicly documented in the Federal Register, providing transparency and opportunities for public input on the rules that govern America's shared natural and cultural heritage."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"Forest Service recent regulation changes
