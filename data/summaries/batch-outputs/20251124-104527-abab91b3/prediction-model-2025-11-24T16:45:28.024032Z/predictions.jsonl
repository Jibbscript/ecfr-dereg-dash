It establishes a government-wide framework for grants and other agreements, aiming to ensure consistency, transparency, and accountability in the use of federal funds. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is the primary agency responsible for issuing and maintaining the guidance within this title.\n\n#### Structure and Scope of Regulations\n\nTitle 2 is organized into two main subtitles:\n\n*   **Subtitle A: Office of Management and Budget Guidance for Grants and Agreements**: This subtitle contains the foundational guidance issued by the OMB for federal awards. It provides the policies and procedures that federal agencies are required to follow when awarding and administering grants and other financial assistance. Key parts of Subtitle A include:\n    *   **Part 200: Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards**, often referred to as the \"Uniform Guidance.\" This is the most significant part of Title 2, consolidating and streamlining requirements for financial management, cost principles, and audits for a wide range of recipients of federal funds.\n    *   Other parts that establish requirements for federal award recipients, such as obtaining a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and registering in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) (Part 25), and reporting on subawards and executive compensation (Part 170).\n\n*   **Subtitle B: Federal Agency Regulations for Grants and Agreements**: This subtitle contains the specific regulations of individual federal agencies that implement the OMB's guidance from Subtitle A. Each agency that provides federal financial assistance has its own chapter in this subtitle, tailoring the government-wide guidance to its specific programs and requirements. This ensures that while there is a uniform foundation, the unique needs of different agencies and their respective missions are also addressed.\n\n#### Agencies Involved\n\nA wide array of federal departments and agencies are involved in the implementation of Title 2, each with its own chapter in Subtitle B. These agencies are responsible for awarding and overseeing federal financial assistance in accordance with the regulations. Key agencies include:\n\n*   Department of Health and Human Services (Chapter III)\n*   Department of Agriculture (Chapter IV)\n*   Department of Energy (Chapter IX)\n*   Department of Defense (Chapter XI)\n*   Department of Transportation (Chapter XII)\n*   Department of Commerce (Chapter XIII)\n*   Department of the Interior (Chapter XIV)\n*   Environmental Protection Agency (Chapter XV)\n*   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (Chapter XVIII)\n*   Department of Homeland Security (Chapter XXX)\n*   Department of Education (Chapter XXXIV)\n\n#### Recent Major Changes\n\nIn 2024, the Office of Management and Budget issued significant revisions to 2 CFR Part 200, the Uniform Guidance, which became effective for new federal awards issued on or after October 1, 2024. The audit requirement changes are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after the same date. These updates were intended to reduce administrative burden, clarify regulations, and incorporate new priorities such as enhancing whistleblower protections and cybersecurity.\n\nKey changes in the 2024 revision include:\n\n*   **Increased Thresholds**: Several important financial thresholds were raised to reduce the administrative burden on recipients.\n    *   The threshold for what is defined as \"equipment\" increased from $5,000 to $10,000.\n    *   The Single Audit threshold was raised from $750,000 to $1,000,000 in federal awards expended in a fiscal year.\n    *   The de minimis indirect cost rate was increased from 10% to 15% of modified total direct costs.\n    *   The maximum value for fixed-amount subawards was increased to $500,000 from $250,000.\n\n*   **Cybersecurity and Disclosures**: New requirements were added to address modern risks and enhance accountability.\n    *   Recipients and subrecipients must now implement \"reasonable cybersecurity and other measures\" to protect sensitive information.\n    *   Mandatory disclosure requirements were expanded to include credible evidence of violations of federal criminal law involving not only fraud, bribery, or gratuity, but also conflict of interest and violations under the False Claims Act.\n\n*   **Plain Language and Clarity**: The revisions aimed to make the regulations easier to understand and apply.\n    *   Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) are now required to be written in plain language to be more accessible to a broader range of applicants.\n    *   The term \"non-federal entity\" has largely been replaced with \"recipient\" and \"subrecipient\" for greater clarity.\n\n*   **Whistleblower Protections**: The updates introduced a new section on whistleblower protections, requiring recipients to inform their employees in writing of their rights under federal law.\n\nThese changes reflect a significant effort by the OMB to modernize the framework for federal financial assistance, making it more efficient and effective for both the government and the entities that receive federal funding."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"detailed summary of 2024 changes to 2 CFR
