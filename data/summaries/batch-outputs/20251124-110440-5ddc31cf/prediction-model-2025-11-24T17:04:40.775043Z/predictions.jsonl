Primarily administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and its various bureaus, these regulations impact a vast spectrum of American businesses and their engagement in the global marketplace. Recent years have seen significant updates to these rules, particularly in the realms of national security-related export controls and the enforcement of trade remedies.\n\nTitle 15 is broadly organized into four subtitles, each addressing a distinct area of commerce and trade.\n\n### Subtitle A: Office of the Secretary of Commerce\n\nThis initial section of Title 15 is largely administrative, outlining the responsibilities, conduct, and legal proceedings related to the Office of the Secretary of Commerce. It covers internal matters such as employee ethics, procedures for handling legal claims, and the disclosure of government information. While foundational, this subtitle does not typically contain the regulations that directly impact the broader business community in their day-to-day commercial activities.\n\n### Subtitle B: Regulations Relating to Commerce and Foreign Trade\n\nAs the most extensive portion of Title 15, Subtitle B is where the bulk of the Department of Commerce's regulatory authority is detailed. It is further divided into chapters, each overseen by a specific agency or bureau:\n\n*   **Bureau of the Census (Chapter I):** This agency is responsible for the Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR), which mandate the filing of Electronic Export Information (EEI) for goods exported from the United States. These regulations are crucial for compiling official U.S. trade statistics and for export control purposes. While the Census Bureau continuously updates its data collection and reporting requirements, recent activities have included notices on information collection and the operational aspects of decennial censuses.\n\n*   **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (Chapter II):** NIST's role is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology. Its regulations and guidance cover a wide range of areas, including cybersecurity, privacy, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, NIST has been active in updating its influential frameworks, including a draft update to its foundational guidance for IoT cybersecurity in May 2025 and new guidelines for media sanitization in September 2025.\n\n*   **International Trade Administration (ITA) (Chapter III):** The ITA is tasked with promoting U.S. exports, strengthening the nation's position in international trade, and ensuring fair trade through the enforcement of trade laws. A primary function is the administration of antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) laws. In a significant recent development, the ITA issued a Final Rule in late 2024, effective January 15, 2025, to amend its AD/CVD regulations. These changes aim to strengthen the ITA's ability to address non-market economies, improve duty collection, and more accurately account for subsidies.\n\n*   **Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) (Chapter VII):** BIS is at the forefront of regulating the export of \"dual-use\" items—those with both commercial and potential military applications—through the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). These regulations are vital to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. BIS has been particularly active with recent rule changes. In a major move on September 29, 2025, BIS issued an interim final rule known as the \"Affiliates Rule,\" which dramatically expanded export restrictions to entities owned 50% or more by parties on the Entity List or Military End-User List. However, in a subsequent turn of events, BIS issued a one-year suspension of this rule on November 10, 2025, as part of trade negotiations.\n\n*   **Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) (Chapter VIII):** The BEA is the nation's primary source for data on the economy, including gross domestic product (GDP) and international trade in services. Its regulations govern the collection of this vital economic data.\n\n*   **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Chapter IX):** NOAA's regulations within Title 15 pertain to the management of the nation's marine resources, including fisheries, marine sanctuaries, and coastal zone management.\n\n### Subtitle C: Regulations Relating to Foreign Trade Agreements\n\nThis subtitle is under the purview of the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR). It contains regulations related to the implementation and enforcement of the various trade agreements the United States has with other countries.\n\n### Subtitle D: Regulations Relating to Telecommunications and Information\n\nWhile some older resources may indicate this subtitle is reserved, it contains regulations administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), another component of the Department of Commerce. These regulations address policies and research related to telecommunications and the internet.\n\nIn summary, Title 15 of the CFR represents a complex and dynamic set of rules that are integral to the functioning of the U.S. economy and its role in global trade. The agencies housed within the Department of Commerce, from the trade-focused ITA and BIS to the standards-setting NIST, are constantly adapting these regulations to new economic realities and national security challenges. Businesses operating in the U.S. and abroad must remain vigilant in their awareness of these regulations and their frequent updates to ensure compliance and successfully navigate the intricacies of domestic and international commerce."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"US Code of Federal Regulations Title 15
