It is designed to ensure the health and welfare of animals, the safety of animal-derived foods, and fair trade practices in the livestock and poultry industries. This summary outlines the key agencies involved in its enforcement, the broad scope of its regulations, and significant recent changes.\n\n#### **Agencies Involved**\n\nThree primary agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are responsible for administering and enforcing the regulations outlined in Title 9:\n\n*   **Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS):** APHIS is responsible for protecting and promoting U.S. agricultural health. Under Title 9, its duties include preventing the introduction and spread of animal diseases, regulating the import and export of animals and animal products, and enforcing the Animal Welfare Act and the Horse Protection Act.\n*   **Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS):** FSIS is the public health agency responsible for ensuring that the nation's commercial supply of meat, poultry, and processed egg products is safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged. FSIS inspects slaughter and processing plants and enforces regulations related to food safety and labeling.\n*   **Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS):** AMS facilitates the strategic marketing of agricultural products while ensuring fair trading practices. Its Packers and Stockyards Program, which absorbed the functions of the former Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), enforces the Packers and Stockyards Act to protect fair trade, prevent deceptive practices, and prohibit discrimination in the livestock, poultry, and meatpacking industries.\n\n#### **Scope of Regulations**\n\nTitle 9 is divided into three chapters, each corresponding to the primary enforcing agencies and their specific regulatory domains:\n\n*   **Chapter I: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS):** This chapter details the regulations for animal welfare, including standards for the humane handling, care, treatment, and transportation of certain animals. It also outlines extensive measures for the control and eradication of communicable diseases in livestock and poultry, such as tuberculosis, brucellosis, and avian influenza. Furthermore, it governs the import and export of animals and animal products to prevent the spread of diseases and regulates veterinary biologics like vaccines and diagnostic kits.\n\n*   **Chapter II: Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS):** This chapter focuses on the Packers and Stockyards Act. Its regulations are designed to ensure that livestock and poultry markets are fair, competitive, and transparent. It prohibits unfair, deceptive, and discriminatory practices by meatpackers, swine contractors, and live poultry dealers.\n\n*   **Chapter III: Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS):** This chapter contains the regulations for ensuring the safety and wholesomeness of meat, poultry, and egg products. It establishes standards for sanitation at processing facilities, mandates inspection procedures, and sets requirements for labeling and packaging. These regulations cover everything from slaughter to processing and are designed to prevent foodborne illnesses.\n\n#### **Recent Major Changes**\n\nIn recent years, Title 9 has undergone several significant updates to address emerging challenges and improve regulatory oversight:\n\n*   **Strengthening Protections for Livestock and Poultry Producers:** The USDA under the Biden-Harris Administration has finalized a series of rules to enhance enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act. These include:\n    *   **Transparency in Poultry Grower Contracting and Tournaments (November 2023):** This rule requires large processing companies to provide poultry growers with more detailed information about the terms of their contracts and the tournament system used for payment.\n    *   **Inclusive Competition and Market Integrity (March 2024):** This rule prohibits discrimination against livestock producers and poultry growers based on characteristics such as race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. It also bans retaliatory practices against producers who communicate with government agencies or assert their legal rights.\n    *   **Poultry Grower Payment Systems and Capital Improvement Systems (January 2025):** This rule aims to provide chicken farmers with greater transparency on payment rates and requires companies to disclose necessary capital improvements for maintaining contracts.\n\n*   **Updates to Biotechnology Regulations:** APHIS has seen significant legal and regulatory shifts concerning genetically engineered (GE) organisms. A 2020 final rule that revised the regulations for the movement of certain GE organisms was vacated by a federal court in December 2024. In response, APHIS reinstated its legacy notification procedures in February 2025 as a streamlined alternative to full permits for regulated GE organisms.\n\n*   **Enhanced Food Safety Measures by FSIS:**\n    *   **Listeria Rule Enhancements:** Following a fatal listeriosis outbreak, FSIS announced in December 2024 that it would expand its testing to include a broader range of *Listeria* species in ready-to-eat food production environments to better assess sanitation effectiveness. The agency has also increased the number of Food Safety Assessments (FSAs) at these facilities.\n    *   **\"Made in the USA\" Labeling:** FSIS issued a final rule, effective January 1, 2026, tightening the requirements for \"Made in the USA\" claims on meat, poultry, and egg products. These claims will only be permissible if the products are derived from animals born, raised, slaughtered, and processed in the United States.\n    *   **National Poultry Improvement Plan:** In September 2025, APHIS finalized changes to the National Poultry Improvement Plan regulations, which include conditioning indemnity for low pathogenicity avian influenza on adherence to biosecurity plans.\n\n*   **Modernization of Export Certification:** Starting in January 2026, FSIS will require all meat and poultry export certificates for Singapore to be generated and issued through its Public Health Information System (PHIS), moving away from paper-based, wet-signed certificates."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"recent major changes to USDA FSIS regulations Title
