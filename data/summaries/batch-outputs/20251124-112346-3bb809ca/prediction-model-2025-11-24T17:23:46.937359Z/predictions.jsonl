This comprehensive summary outlines the key agencies involved in its enforcement, the scope of its regulations, and recent major changes that have impacted the industries and public.\n\n#### **Key Enforcement Agencies**\n\nTwo primary federal agencies, operating under different departments, are responsible for administering and enforcing the regulations outlined in Title 27:\n\n*   **The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB):** A bureau within the Department of the Treasury, the TTB's primary responsibilities include collecting federal excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and ammunition. It also regulates the production, labeling, and marketing of alcohol and tobacco products to ensure consumer protection and fair trade practices. This includes issuing permits for producers, importers, and wholesalers of alcoholic beverages.\n*   **The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF):** A law enforcement agency within the Department of Justice, the ATF is responsible for enforcing federal criminal laws related to the illegal use, manufacture, and possession of firearms and explosives. It also investigates acts of arson, bombings, and the illegal trafficking of alcohol and tobacco products. The ATF regulates the firearms and explosives industries, including licensing for manufacturers, dealers, and importers.\n\nThis division of responsibilities was established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which split the former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms into the two current agencies.\n\n#### **Scope of Regulations**\n\nTitle 27 is divided into two main chapters, reflecting the jurisdictions of the TTB and the ATF.\n\n**Chapter I: Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)**\nThis chapter details the TTB's extensive regulations covering the entire lifecycle of alcohol and tobacco products, from production to sale. Key areas of regulation include:\n\n*   **Alcohol:** The regulations for alcoholic beverages are extensive, covering wine, beer, and distilled spirits. These include standards of identity, labeling and advertising requirements, and regulations on trade practices such as \"tied house\" arrangements, commercial bribery, and consignment sales. The TTB is also responsible for approving American Viticultural Areas (AVAs). Specific parts address the importation and exportation of alcoholic beverages, as well as the requirements for obtaining federal permits to operate in the industry.\n*   **Tobacco:** The TTB's tobacco regulations focus on the manufacture, importation, and taxation of tobacco products, including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and processed tobacco. These regulations are designed to ensure the proper collection of federal excise taxes and to monitor the domestic tobacco trade.\n*   **Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax:** The TTB is responsible for the collection of excise taxes on the manufacture of firearms and ammunition.\n\n**Chapter II: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)**\nThis chapter focuses on the criminal enforcement and regulation of firearms and explosives. Key areas of regulation include:\n\n*   **Firearms:** The ATF's regulations cover commerce in firearms and ammunition, including the licensing of manufacturers, importers, and dealers. It sets forth requirements for the conduct of business by licensees, including record-keeping and background checks. Regulations also address the importation of firearms, destructive devices, and machine guns.\n*   **Explosives:** The ATF regulates the commerce in explosives, including licensing and permit requirements for those who import, manufacture, or deal in explosive materials.\n*   **Contraband:** The ATF has regulations concerning contraband cigarettes.\n\n#### **Recent Major Changes**\n\nIn recent years, Title 27 has seen several significant regulatory changes and proposed updates affecting the alcohol and firearms industries:\n\n**Alcohol (Regulated by TTB):**\n*   **New Standards of Fill:** In January 2025, the TTB issued a final rule authorizing 13 new standards of fill for wine and 15 for distilled spirits, providing greater flexibility for producers and more options for consumers. This change also eliminated the distinction between container types for distilled spirits, applying the same standards to cans and other containers.\n*   **Proposed \"Alcohol Facts\" Labeling:** The TTB has proposed new regulations that would mandate \"Alcohol Facts\" panels on alcoholic beverage labels. This would require the disclosure of serving size, servings per container, alcohol content, calories, and grams of carbohydrates, fat, and protein.\n\n**Firearms (Regulated by ATF):**\n*   **\"Engaged in the Business\" Rule:** In April 2024, the ATF finalized a rule to implement the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which broadened the definition of who is \"engaged in the business\" of dealing in firearms and thus required to obtain a federal firearms license and conduct background checks. This rule has faced legal challenges.\n*   **Repeal of \"Zero Tolerance\" Policy:** In April 2025, the ATF announced the repeal of its \"zero tolerance\" policy, which had mandated license revocation for certain willful violations. The new framework focuses on serious or willful repeat violations.\n*   **Stabilizing Braces Rule:** A 2023 ATF final rule that classified certain firearms with stabilizing braces as short-barreled rifles, requiring registration under the National Firearms Act, has been the subject of significant legal battles. Court rulings in 2024 vacated the rule.\n*   **Elimination of NFA Tax for Certain Items:** Legislation signed into law on July 4, 2025, eliminated the $200 National Firearms Act tax for suppressors, short-barreled rifles, short-barreled shotguns, and \"any other weapons\" (AOWs), effective January 1, 2026. Registration requirements for these items remain in place.\n\n**Tobacco:**\n*   **Nationwide Minimum Age of 21:** A significant change impacting tobacco sales was the federal law passed in December 2019, which raised the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 nationwide. The FDA has since issued a final rule to conform its regulations to this new minimum age."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"ATF recent rule
