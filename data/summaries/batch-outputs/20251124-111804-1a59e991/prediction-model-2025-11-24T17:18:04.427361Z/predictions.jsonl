It is the principal set of regulations issued by federal agencies to govern the planning, funding, construction, maintenance, and safety of the country's surface transportation system. This summary delves into the key agencies that enforce these regulations, the extensive scope of their oversight, and the significant recent changes that are reshaping America's infrastructure landscape.\n\n### The Custodians of the Code: Agencies Involved\n\nWhile multiple federal bodies have a hand in the implementation of Title 23, the primary authority rests with the **U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)**. Within the DOT, several key administrations are responsible for specific chapters and parts of the code:\n\n*   **Federal Highway Administration (FHWA):** The FHWA is the lead agency for the majority of Title 23, overseeing the federal-aid highway program, which provides financial and technical assistance to states for constructing, improving, and preserving the nation's highway system. Its authority extends to areas such as highway design, construction standards, right-of-way acquisition, and environmental review.\n\n*   **National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA):** NHTSA takes the lead on matters of highway safety. It is responsible for developing and implementing safety programs aimed at reducing crashes, injuries, and fatalities on the nation's roads. This includes setting standards for state highway safety programs, collecting and analyzing crash data, and administering grant programs for initiatives like seat belt use, and reducing impaired driving.\n\n*   **Federal Transit Administration (FTA):** While the FTA's primary focus is on public transportation, its regulations can intersect with Title 23, particularly in areas where highway projects include transit components, such as dedicated bus lanes or park-and-ride facilities.\n\n*   **Federal Lands Management Agencies:** For highways that traverse federal lands, other agencies play a significant role. These include the **National Park Service**, the **Forest Service**, the **Fish and Wildlife Service**, and the **Bureau of Indian Affairs**. They work in conjunction with the FHWA to manage the Federal Lands Highways Program, ensuring that road projects in these areas are consistent with the conservation and recreational missions of these lands.\n\n### A Broad Mandate: The Scope of Regulations\n\nTitle 23 is organized into three chapters, which are further divided into numerous parts, each addressing a specific aspect of highway transportation. This structure provides a comprehensive framework that governs nearly every facet of the nation's road network. Key areas of regulation include:\n\n*   **Federal-Aid Highways:** A significant portion of Title 23 is dedicated to the administration of the Federal-Aid Highway Program. This includes the apportionment of federal funds to states, project approval processes, and the standards that must be met for a project to be eligible for federal funding.\n*   **Highway Safety:** This includes uniform procedures for state highway safety grant programs, guidelines for addressing issues like drunk driving and seat belt use, and the operation of the National Driver Register.\n*   **Environmental Protection:** Title 23 contains extensive regulations aimed at mitigating the environmental impact of highway projects. This includes procedures for conducting environmental impact assessments under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as well as rules for noise abatement, wetland protection, and ensuring projects do not adversely affect parks and historic sites.\n*   **Civil Rights:** The regulations enforce civil rights laws in the context of highway projects, ensuring non-discrimination and promoting equal opportunity in all federally-funded transportation programs.\n*   **Infrastructure and Operations:** This encompasses a wide range of technical standards, including those for the design and construction of roads and bridges, traffic control devices, and the implementation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). It also includes recent additions for national electric vehicle infrastructure.\n*   **Planning and Research:** Title 23 mandates a cooperative, continuous, and comprehensive planning process for transportation in metropolitan areas and states. It also provides for funding for research and technology development to improve highway safety and efficiency.\n\n### Reshaping the Roads: Recent Major Changes\n\nTitle 23 is a dynamic set of regulations, frequently updated to reflect new legislation and national priorities. The most significant recent changes have been driven by the **Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)**, signed into law in November 2021. This landmark legislation has introduced a host of new programs and amended existing regulations in Title 23, with a focus on modernization, resilience, and equity.\n\nKey changes stemming from the IIJA include:\n\n*   **New Grant Programs:** The IIJA established several new grant programs administered through Title 23, including the **Carbon Reduction Program**, which provides funding for projects that reduce transportation emissions, and the **National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program**, which aims to build out a national network of electric vehicle charging stations.\n*   **Increased Federal Share for Certain Projects:** The IIJA has altered the federal cost-sharing requirements for various projects, in some cases increasing the federal share to 100% for certain safety-related projects and for projects on tribal transportation facilities.\n*   **Alternative Contracting Methods:** To expedite project delivery, the IIJA expanded the use of alternative contracting methods, such as design-build and construction manager/general contractor, for a wider range of projects, including those on federal lands.\n*   **Emphasis on Resilience and Climate Change:** The legislation places a strong emphasis on making the nation's transportation infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events. This includes funding for projects that protect against natural disasters and the establishment of regional Centers of Excellence for Resilience and Adaptation.\n*   **Streamlined Environmental Review:** In conjunction with other recent legislation, there is a push to streamline the environmental review process for infrastructure projects. An interim final rule issued in July 2025 amends parts of Title 23 to align with updates to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), aiming to create a more efficient and predictable process while still ensuring environmental protection.\n*   **Innovative Finance and Asset Concessions:** The IIJA includes provisions to encourage private sector investment in public infrastructure through innovative financing mechanisms and public-private partnerships. It adds a new section on \"asset concessions,\" which are long-term lease agreements between public entities and private companies.\n\nIn conclusion, Title 23 of the Code of Federal Regulations is a foundational document for the American transportation system. Administered by a network of federal agencies, it provides a comprehensive framework for the development, operation, and safety of the nation's highways. The recent infusion of funding and new priorities from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is leading to significant updates within Title 23, heralding a new era of investment and innovation in America's infrastructure."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"structure and purpose of US CFR Title
