This extensive title provides the detailed framework for the administration of immigration, citizenship, and the rights and responsibilities of non-citizens within the United States.\n\n**Agencies Involved:**\n\nThe implementation and enforcement of the regulations outlined in Title 8 are primarily handled by two key executive departments: the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nWithin the **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**, several agencies have distinct roles:\n*   **U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS):** USCIS is responsible for processing and adjudicating a wide range of immigration and naturalization applications and petitions. This includes applications for visas, permanent residency (Green Cards), and citizenship.\n*   **U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE):** ICE is the principal investigative and enforcement arm for federal criminal and civil laws concerning immigration, customs, trade, and border control. Its responsibilities are divided between Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which investigates transnational crime, and Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), which manages the apprehension, detention, and removal of non-citizens who are in violation of immigration laws.\n*   **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP):** CBP is tasked with securing U.S. borders at and between official ports of entry. This includes inspecting individuals and goods to prevent unlawful entry and the smuggling of contraband.\n\nWithin the **Department of Justice (DOJ)**, the key agency is:\n*   **Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR):** The EOIR is responsible for adjudicating immigration cases. It includes the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which hears appeals of decisions made by immigration judges and certain DHS actions, and the immigration judges who preside over removal proceedings in immigration courts.\n\nWhile DHS and DOJ are the primary actors, other departments, such as the Department of State, which is involved in visa processing at U.S. embassies and consulates abroad, also play a role in the broader immigration system.\n\n**Scope of Regulations:**\n\nTitle 8 of the CFR is extensive and covers a wide array of topics related to aliens and nationality. The regulations are organized into chapters and parts that detail the procedures and requirements for various immigration processes. Key areas covered under Title 8 include:\n\n*   **Immigration Petitions and Visa Applications:** Procedures for family-based and employment-based immigrant petitions, as well as the requirements for various nonimmigrant visa categories.\n*   **Admission and Removal:** Regulations governing the inspection of persons applying for admission into the U.S., expedited removal proceedings, and the grounds for inadmissibility and deportability.\n*   **Asylum and Refugee Status:** The processes for applying for asylum and refugee status, including procedures for credible fear screenings and asylum interviews.\n*   **Naturalization and Citizenship:** The requirements and procedures for foreign nationals to become U.S. citizens.\n*   **Control of Employment of Aliens:** Regulations pertaining to employment eligibility verification (Form I-9) and the enforcement of laws against hiring unauthorized workers.\n*   **Detention and Removal Proceedings:** Rules governing the apprehension, detention, and removal of non-citizens from the United States.\n\n**Recent Major Changes:**\n\nThe regulations within Title 8 are subject to change through the federal rulemaking process. Recent years have seen several significant developments:\n\n*   **\"Securing the Border\" Interim Final Rule (June 2024):** Following a presidential proclamation, the DHS and DOJ issued an interim final rule to suspend and limit the entry of certain non-citizens across the southern border during periods of high border encounters. This rule places limitations on asylum eligibility for those who enter under specified emergency circumstances. The rule was made effective in early June 2024.\n\n*   **Proposed Rule on Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility (November 2025):** The DHS has proposed a new rule regarding the \"public charge\" ground of inadmissibility. This proposed regulation aims to amend the criteria used to determine whether a non-citizen is likely to become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. The comment period for this proposed rule was set to end in December 2025.\n\n*   **Executive Order on Alien Registration (January 2025):** An executive order was issued directing DHS to ensure that non-citizens comply with their legal obligation to register with the U.S. government under the Immigration and Nationality Act. This includes the creation of a new form and online process for registration.\n\n*   **Proposed Legislation:** While not yet enacted into law, several bills have been introduced in Congress that could significantly amend the Immigration and Nationality Act and, consequently, Title 8 of the CFR. For example, H.R. 6477 proposes reforms to the inspection process for applicants for admission, while H.R. 2374, the \"New Way Forward Act,\" seeks to reform various aspects of immigration enforcement and relief from removal.\n\nThese recent changes reflect ongoing efforts to address the complexities of the U.S. immigration system, from border security to the criteria for legal residency and the processes for seeking humanitarian protection. To stay informed of the latest updates, it is advisable to consult the Federal Register and the electronic CFR (e-CFR), which is continuously updated."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"recent major changes to Title 8
