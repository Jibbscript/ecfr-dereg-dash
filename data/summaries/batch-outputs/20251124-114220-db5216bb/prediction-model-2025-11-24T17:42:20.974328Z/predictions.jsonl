This title is organized into several subtitles, each addressing a distinct regulatory area and involving various federal agencies.\n\n#### Agencies Involved\n\nA number of federal agencies are instrumental in the development, implementation, and enforcement of the regulations within Title 41. Key among them are:\n\n*   **General Services Administration (GSA):** The GSA plays a central role in overseeing the Federal Property Management Regulations and the Federal Travel Regulation.,\n*   **Department of Labor (DOL):** The DOL is responsible for regulations concerning public contracts, including labor standards and equal employment opportunity provisions.,\n*   **Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP):** As part of the DOL, the OFCCP enforces contractual promises of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action.\n*   **Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled:** This committee oversees a program that provides employment opportunities for individuals with significant disabilities through federal procurement.\n*   **Department of Energy (DOE), Department of the Interior (DOI), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Department of Justice (DOJ):** These agencies have specific property management regulations that fall under the umbrella of Title 41.\n\n#### Scope of Regulations\n\nTitle 41 is divided into several subtitles, with the most significant and currently active ones being Subtitles B, C, and F.\n\n**Subtitle A - Federal Procurement Regulations System:** This subtitle was largely superseded by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in 1983, which is now codified in Title 48 of the CFR.\n\n**Subtitle B - Other Provisions Relating to Public Contracts:** This subtitle focuses on various aspects of public contracts and is divided into several key chapters:\n*   **Chapter 50 - Public Contracts, Department of Labor:** This chapter, under the purview of the DOL, addresses labor standards for federal supply contracts, including minimum wage, overtime, and safety and health standards.\n*   **Chapter 51 - Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled:** These regulations govern the \"AbilityOne\" program, which requires federal agencies to purchase certain supplies and services from nonprofit agencies employing people who are blind or have other severe disabilities.\n*   **Chapter 60 - Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor:** This chapter implements Executive Order 11246 and other laws that prohibit federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating in employment based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. It also mandates affirmative action to ensure equal opportunity.,\n\n**Subtitle C - Federal Property Management Regulations System:** This extensive subtitle provides the framework for the management of federal property. It is primarily administered by the GSA and includes:\n*   **Chapter 101 - Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR):** While much of the FPMR has been superseded by the FMR, some parts remain, covering topics like the management of buildings and grounds.,\n*   **Chapter 102 - Federal Management Regulation (FMR):** This is the successor to the FPMR and contains updated policies for managing federal administrative programs., The FMR is organized into subchapters covering:\n    *   **Personal Property:** Including government aircraft and motor vehicle management.\n    *   **Real Property:** Addressing real estate acquisition, facility management, and property disposal.\n    *   **Transportation:** Covering the shipment of government property and employees' personal effects.\n    *   **General and Administrative Programs:** Including home-to-work transportation, mail management, and the use of records.\n\n**Subtitle F - Federal Travel Regulation (FTR):** This subtitle, also managed by the GSA, establishes the policies and procedures for travel by federal civilian employees and others authorized to travel at government expense., The FTR covers:\n*   **Chapter 301 - Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel Allowances:** Details regulations for transportation expenses, per diem rates, and reimbursement for official travel.,\n*   **Chapter 302 - Relocation Allowances:** Governs the allowances for employees who are relocating for official purposes.\n*   **Chapter 304 - Payment of Travel Expenses from a Non-Federal Source:** Outlines the rules for accepting travel payments from non-federal sources.\n\n#### Recent Major Changes and Proposed Amendments\n\nTitle 41 is subject to ongoing updates to reflect new legislation, executive orders, and evolving government priorities. Some recent and proposed changes include:\n\n*   **Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) Amendments:**\n    *   A final rule effective March 26, 2024, gives federal agencies greater flexibility in authorizing the shipment of an employee's alternative-fueled privately-owned vehicle during relocation or extending driving times for these vehicles if necessary.\n    *   In April 2025, the GSA announced plans to rescind a 2024 rule that updated the FTR with diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility language, reverting to sex-specific pronouns. This change is in response to Executive Orders issued in January 2025.\n    *   In May 2025, the GSA announced the rescission of 36 FTR Bulletins that were deemed outdated, expired, or no longer in effect due to recent executive actions.\n\n*   **Federal Management Regulation (FMR) and Property Management Changes:**\n    *   The Department of Homeland Security issued a final rule in June 2025, with an effective date of November 5, 2025, to establish regulations for the protection of Federal property.\n    *   The GSA proposed amendments to the FMR in December 2024 concerning the disposition of real property to align with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act.\n    *   In November 2024, the GSA issued a final rule to update language in the FMR related to transportation management to be more inclusive. However, a planned rescission of this rule was announced in April 2025.,\n\n*   **Public Contracts and Affirmative Action Proposed Changes:**\n    *   In July 2025, the Department of Labor published a proposed rule to rescind regulations implementing Executive Order 11246, which mandates affirmative action and equal employment opportunity for federal contractors. This proposal, if finalized, would eliminate the requirement for federal contractors to maintain written affirmative action plans for women and minorities.,\n    *   Another proposed rule from July 2025 would revise regulations for individuals with disabilities, removing the requirement for contractors to invite self-identification of disability status and eliminating the seven percent utilization goal.\n\n*   **Inflationary Adjustments:**\n    *   In November 2024, the Department of Defense, GSA, and NASA proposed an amendment to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to adjust statutory acquisition-related thresholds for inflation, as required every five years by 41 U.S.C. 1908. This rule is expected to take effect on October 1, 2025."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"recent changes to Federal Travel
