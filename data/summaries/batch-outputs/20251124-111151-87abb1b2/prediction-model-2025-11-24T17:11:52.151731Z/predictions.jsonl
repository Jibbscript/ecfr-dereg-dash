This vital section of federal law outlines the legal framework for tariffs, trade agreements, and the enforcement of customs laws, directly impacting international trade and the U.S. economy.\n\n### Key Agencies and Their Roles\n\nSeveral federal agencies are tasked with the administration and enforcement of the regulations stipulated in Title 19. The primary agencies include:\n\n*   **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP):** As a component of the Department of Homeland Security, CBP is at the forefront of enforcing Title 19 regulations. It is responsible for managing, controlling, and protecting the nation's borders, including the collection of import duties and the enforcement of trade and navigation laws.\n*   **Department of the Treasury:** This department works in concert with CBP, particularly on matters related to customs revenue functions. Regulations concerning import quotas, trade bans, user fees, and duty assessment are often issued under the joint authority of the Departments of the Treasury and Homeland Security.\n*   **U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC):** The ITC is an independent, quasi-judicial federal agency that investigates the impact of imports on U.S. industries and directs actions against unfair trade practices. Its regulations are found within Title 19.\n*   **International Trade Administration (ITA):** Housed within the Department of Commerce, the ITA's mission is to promote U.S. exports of nonagricultural goods and services. Its regulations concerning international trade are also included in Title 19.\n\n### A Broad Scope of Regulations\n\nTitle 19 is extensive, covering a wide array of topics essential to the flow of goods across U.S. borders. The regulations are organized into chapters and parts, each addressing specific areas of customs law. Key areas of regulation include:\n\n*   **Vessels in Foreign and Domestic Trades:** Detailed rules for the arrival, entry, and clearance of vessels, as well as the transportation of goods by water.\n*   **Entry of Merchandise:** Procedures for the formal and informal entry of imported goods, including documentation requirements and the classification and appraisement of merchandise.\n*   **Customs Brokers:** Regulations for the licensing, duties, and responsibilities of customs brokers who transact customs business on behalf of others.\n*   **Trade Agreements and Preferential Treatment:** Rules of origin and other provisions related to various free trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), and other preferential trade programs.\n*   **Special Classes of Merchandise:** Specific regulations for the importation of certain types of goods, such as alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and products subject to intellectual property rights.\n*   **Quotas and Marking:** Regulations governing import quotas on certain goods and the requirement for articles to be marked with their country of origin.\n*   **Transportation in Bond and Merchandise in Transit:** Procedures for the movement of merchandise that has not yet been cleared by customs.\n*   **Customs Warehouses and Foreign Trade Zones:** Rules for the establishment and operation of customs warehouses and foreign trade zones.\n\n### Recent Major Changes: Modernizing Customs Broker Regulations\n\nA significant recent overhaul of Title 19 came with the \"Modernization of the Customs Broker Regulations,\" with final rules published in October 2022 and becoming effective in December 2022. These changes, the most substantial in many years, were driven by the need to align regulations with contemporary business practices and the electronic environment of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE).\n\nKey changes from this modernization effort include:\n\n*   **Transition to National Permits:** The new regulations eliminate the old system of broker districts and district-specific permits. Now, all licensed customs brokers operate under a single national permit, allowing them to conduct customs business anywhere in the United States. This change is intended to provide greater flexibility and simplify operations for brokers.\n*   **Updated \"Responsible Supervision and Control\" Requirements:** The regulations have been updated to clarify the requirements for brokers to exercise responsible supervision and control over their employees and operations. This includes new factors that CBP will consider when assessing a broker's compliance.\n*   **Direct Communication with Importers:** The modernized rules emphasize direct communication between customs brokers and the importers of record. A key provision requires that powers of attorney be executed directly between the broker and the importer, rather than through a freight forwarder or other third party.\n*   **Enhanced Reporting and Record-Keeping:** The new regulations introduce additional reporting requirements, such as mandating that brokers report security breaches to CBP within 72 hours and provide a list of affected Importer of Record numbers.\n\nThese recent amendments represent a significant shift in the landscape of customs brokerage in the United States, aiming to enhance efficiency, security, and compliance in an increasingly digital and interconnected global trade environment."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"US Code of Federal
