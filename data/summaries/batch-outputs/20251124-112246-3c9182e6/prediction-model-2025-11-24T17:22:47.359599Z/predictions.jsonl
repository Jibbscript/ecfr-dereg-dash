It is the definitive source for all federal tax laws, governing the assessment and collection of taxes by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This extensive set of regulations impacts individuals, corporations, estates, and trusts, outlining their obligations for reporting income, paying taxes, and claiming deductions and exemptions.\n\nThe regulations codified in Title 26 are the official interpretation of the IRC by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and provide the framework for defining taxable income, deductions, credits, and filing requirements. These laws are implemented and enforced by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a bureau of the Department of the Treasury, which uses Title 26 to conduct audits, assess penalties, and ensure compliance with federal tax laws. While the IRS is the primary agency, the Department of the Treasury also plays a key role in issuing and interpreting these regulations.\n\n### Scope of Regulations\n\nThe scope of Title 26 is vast, covering a wide array of federal taxes. The major categories of taxes governed by this title include:\n\n*   **Income Taxes:** This is the most extensive part of Title 26, with detailed rules for individual and corporate income taxes. It defines what constitutes gross income, outlines various deductions and credits, and sets the tax rates.\n*   **Estate and Gift Taxes:** These regulations pertain to taxes on the transfer of wealth from one person to another, either upon death (estate tax) or while alive (gift tax).\n*   **Employment Taxes:** This section covers taxes related to employment, including Social Security and Medicare taxes (FICA), and federal unemployment taxes (FUTA).\n*   **Excise Taxes:** Title 26 imposes taxes on the sale of specific goods and services, such as fuel, tobacco, and alcohol. It also includes more recent additions like the excise tax on corporate stock repurchases.\n*   **Procedure and Administration:** A significant portion of Title 26 is dedicated to the procedural aspects of taxation, including rules for filing returns, the audit process, taxpayer rights, and the appeals process.\n\n### Recent Major Changes\n\nThe landscape of federal tax law is ever-evolving, with Congress frequently making changes to the Internal Revenue Code that necessitate updates to Title 26. Some of the most significant recent changes include:\n\n**Inflation Reduction Act of 2022:** This act introduced several key tax provisions, including a new **1% excise tax on the fair market value of corporate stock repurchased by a covered corporation** after December 31, 2022. The Treasury Department and the IRS have since issued final regulations to provide guidance on the application of this new tax.\n\n**\"One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act\" (OBBBA):** More formally known as Public Law 119-21, this act introduced new tax deductions for individuals for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024, and ending before January 1, 2029. The IRS and Treasury Department have issued guidance for these new provisions, which include:\n*   A deduction for **\"qualified tips.\"**\n*   A deduction for **\"qualified overtime compensation.\"**\n\nThe Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) provides a continuously updated version of Title 26, reflecting the latest amendments and allowing taxpayers and tax professionals to stay current with the law. Given the complexity and frequent updates to the tax code, individuals and businesses are encouraged to consult the latest version of the regulations or seek professional advice to ensure compliance."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"what is the scope of CFR Title
