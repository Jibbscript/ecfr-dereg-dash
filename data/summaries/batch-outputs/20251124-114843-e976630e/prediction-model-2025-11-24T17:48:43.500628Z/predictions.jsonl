It provides the legal framework for federal agencies to prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the impacts of all types of hazards.\n\n#### **Agencies Involved**\n\nThe principal agency responsible for the implementation and oversight of Title 44 is the **Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)**, a component of the **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**. FEMA oversees the vast majority of the regulations within this title, covering a wide spectrum of emergency management functions.\n\nOther federal agencies also play a role in specific sections of Title 44:\n\n*   **Department of Commerce and Department of Transportation:** These departments regulate specific aspects of emergency management, particularly concerning shipping restrictions and the use of American flag ships and aircraft during emergencies, as detailed in Parts 400-499.\n*   **Other Federal Agencies:** In the context of specific emergencies, such as those involving commercial nuclear power plants, FEMA may call upon numerous other federal agencies to participate in planning and response. These can include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, among others.\n\n#### **Scope of Regulations**\n\nCFR Title 44 is extensive, addressing a broad range of activities and programs related to managing emergencies and disasters. The regulations are organized into several subchapters, each focusing on a specific area of emergency management:\n\n*   **General Provisions:** This includes rules on rulemaking, the disclosure of information, and intergovernmental review of FEMA's programs.\n*   **Insurance and Hazard Mitigation:** A significant portion of Title 44 is dedicated to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), outlining its operational details, insurance coverage and rates, and procedures for mapping flood hazard areas. It also covers various hazard mitigation grant programs.\n*   **Fire Prevention and Control:** This section includes regulations related to public safety awards and fire assistance programs.\n*   **Disaster Assistance:** This is one of the most critical sections, detailing the process for presidential disaster declarations and the provision of various forms of federal assistance. This includes the Public Assistance program, which provides aid to state, tribal, and local governments, and certain private nonprofit organizations for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities. It also covers the Individual Assistance program, which provides financial and direct services to individuals and households affected by disasters.\n*   **Preparedness:** These regulations focus on building capabilities at the state and local levels through programs for emergency management training and education, radiological emergency preparedness, and national earthquake hazards reduction.\n*   **Defense Production Act:** Title 44 also includes provisions related to the use of the Defense Production Act to prioritize and allocate resources during national emergencies.\n\n#### **Recent Major Changes**\n\nCFR Title 44 is a dynamic set of regulations, subject to updates and amendments to reflect new legislation, lessons learned from disasters, and evolving risks. As of late 2024 and early 2025, several significant changes have been proposed and implemented:\n\n*   **Updates to Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands:** In 2024, FEMA issued a final rule to update its regulations for floodplain management and the protection of wetlands. This rule, which took effect in October 2024, implements the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS). Key changes include adopting a climate-informed science approach to define floodplains, increasing freeboard standards for new and substantially damaged structures, and promoting nature-based solutions for flood mitigation. These changes aim to enhance the resilience of communities and federal assets against the growing impacts of flooding. The amendments from September 9, 2024, apply to new actions for which assistance is made available on or after that date under the Stafford Act.\n\n*   **Proposed Updates to Public Assistance Program Regulations:** In 2024, FEMA proposed a significant update to its Public Assistance program regulations (44 CFR Part 206) to incorporate statutory changes and improve program administration. The proposed rule aims to clarify eligibility requirements and was open for public comment. Key proposed changes include:\n    *   Incorporating provisions from the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (PKEMRA) and the Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA).\n    *   Explicitly including Indian Tribal governments as eligible to act as recipients or subrecipients.\n    *   Clarifying the eligibility of houses of worship as private nonprofit organizations.\n    *   Updating the definition of \"permanent work\" to align with the latest building codes and hazard-resistant design standards.\n\nThese recent and proposed changes underscore the ongoing effort to modernize the nation's emergency management framework, with a heightened focus on climate resilience, equity, and administrative efficiency. The eCFR, a continuously updated online version of the Code of Federal Regulations, indicates that Title 44 was last amended on December 31, 2024."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"scope of regulations in US CFR Title
