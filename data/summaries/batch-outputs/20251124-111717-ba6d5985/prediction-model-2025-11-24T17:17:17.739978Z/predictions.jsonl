This critical section of federal law outlines the operational framework for a host of U.S. government agencies involved in diplomacy, foreign aid, and international trade. Recent years have seen significant updates to these regulations, particularly in the realms of foreign assistance, export controls, and consular services.\n\n### Key Agencies and Scope of Regulations\n\nTitle 22 is a comprehensive document that codifies the regulations of several key federal bodies. The most prominent among these is the **U.S. Department of State**, which holds the broadest jurisdiction under this title. Its regulations cover a vast array of topics, including:\n\n*   **Diplomatic and Consular Services:** Rules pertaining to the operation of U.S. embassies and consulates, the duties of Foreign Service officers, and the protection of U.S. citizens abroad.\n*   **Visas and Passports:** The issuance, denial, and revocation of visas for foreign nationals and passports for U.S. citizens.\n*   **International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR):** Strict controls on the export and import of defense-related articles and services, found in Parts 120-130, to safeguard U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.\n\nAnother major agency operating under Title 22 is the **U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)**. USAID's regulations, primarily located in 2 CFR Part 700, govern the administration of U.S. foreign assistance programs. This includes the rules for grants and cooperative agreements with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and for-profit entities.\n\nOther significant agencies with regulations in Title 22 include:\n\n*   The **Peace Corps**, with rules on volunteer eligibility, standards of conduct, and program administration.\n*   The **United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM)**, which oversees government-sponsored international broadcasting.\n*   The **U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)**, which provides financing for private development projects in lower- and middle-income countries.\n*   The **Inter-American Foundation** and the **African Development Foundation**, which support community-led development in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa.\n\n### Recent Major Changes and Updates\n\nIn recent years, several significant amendments and proposed changes have been made to Title 22, reflecting evolving foreign policy priorities and administrative reforms.\n\n**U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID):**\n\nA significant update is a **direct final rule effective October 1, 2024**, which revises USAID's assistance regulations in 2 CFR Part 700 to align with new guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This rule aims to clarify regulations, use plain language, and reduce the burden on recipients of federal awards. Key changes include expanded nondiscrimination protections to cover sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors, as well as an increase in the audit threshold for recipients from $750,000 to $1 million.\n\nUSAID has also issued a **proposed rule to enhance safeguarding measures**. Published in February 2024, this proposal would add a new subpart (722.70) to the Agency for International Development Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) focused on \"Safeguarding Against Exploitation, Sexual Abuse, Child Abuse, and Child Neglect.\" This would require contractors to implement compliance plans and report any credible allegations of such misconduct. The proposed rule is part of a broader effort to strengthen protections for vulnerable populations in foreign assistance programs.\n\n**Department of State:**\n\nThe Department of State has implemented significant changes to the **International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)**. A final rule, effective September 15, 2025, expands the U.S. Munitions List (USML) to include new technologies such as advanced aircraft parts and large unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). This move reverses a trend of shrinking the USML and signals a more stringent approach to controlling defense-related exports. The rule also creates a new licensing exemption for certain UUVs used for scientific or civil purposes. Further amendments in March and April 2024 also revised USML Category XI concerning high-energy storage capacitors. Additionally, a temporary modification to USML Category VIII has been extended until December 1, 2026.\n\nIn January 2024, the Department of State proposed two rules to introduce a **\"Nondiscrimination in Foreign Assistance\"** clause in its contracts and grants. These proposed rules would have prohibited discrimination on various bases, including race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation. However, these notices of proposed rulemaking were **withdrawn in January 2025**.\n\nThe Department of State also finalized a rule in March 2023, which became effective May 30, 2023, to adjust the **Schedule of Fees for Consular Services**. This rule increased the application processing fees for several nonimmigrant visa categories to better align with the actual cost of providing these services. A temporary final rule effective from June 1, 2023, to December 31, 2024, also exempted certain Afghan immigrant visa applicants from paying application processing and Affidavit of Support review fees.\n\nThese recent updates to CFR Title 22 underscore a dynamic regulatory landscape for U.S. foreign relations, with a clear focus on enhancing accountability, protecting vulnerable populations, and adapting to new technological and geopolitical realities. Stakeholders in the international arena are advised to stay abreast of these ongoing changes."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"Department of State \"Nondiscrimination in Foreign Assistance\" proposed rule
