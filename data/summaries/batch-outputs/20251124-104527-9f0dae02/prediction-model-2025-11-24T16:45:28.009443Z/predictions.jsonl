It serves as the official compilation of presidential documents and regulations pertaining to the Executive Office of the President (EOP). This summary outlines the agencies involved, the scope of its regulations, and notable recent changes.\n\n**Agencies Involved**\n\nThe primary entity governed by and responsible for the content of 3 CFR is the **Executive Office of the President (EOP)**. Established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the EOP is composed of various offices and councils that support the work of the President. Key sub-agencies within the EOP that fall under the purview of these regulations include:\n\n*   The White House Office\n*   Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\n*   National Security Council\n*   Council of Economic Advisers\n*   Council on Environmental Quality\n*   Office of National Drug Control Policy\n*   Office of Science and Technology Policy\n*   Office of the United States Trade Representative\n*   Office of Administration\n*   Office of the National Cyber Director\n\nWhile the EOP and its components are the central focus, the **Office of the Federal Register (OFR)**, a part of the **National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)**, plays the crucial role of publishing and codifying the documents that constitute Title 3.\n\n**Scope of Regulations**\n\nThe scope of 3 CFR is twofold, encompassing both the official pronouncements of the President and the rules governing the administration of the Executive Office of the President.\n\n**1. Presidential Documents:** A significant portion of Title 3 is not a set of traditional regulations but rather a compilation of official documents issued by the President. These documents have legal effect and include:\n*   **Executive Orders:** Directives from the President to federal agencies on how to manage their operations.\n*   **Proclamations:** Official announcements of the President on matters of public policy, such as holidays, special observances, and trade policies.\n*   **Presidential Memoranda, Notices, Determinations, Letters, and Orders:** Other forms of presidential directives that carry legal authority.\n\nThese documents are published in the Federal Register and then compiled into Title 3. This compilation makes Title 3 a vital historical record and legal reference for the actions of a presidential administration.\n\n**2. Codified Regulations:** Chapter I of Title 3 contains codified regulations for the Executive Office of the President. These are more traditional rules that govern the conduct and operations of EOP employees and offices. The key parts of this chapter include:\n*   **Part 100 - Standards of Conduct:** This part addresses the ethical conduct and potential conflicts of interest for employees of the Executive Office of the President.\n*   **Part 101 - Public Information Provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act:** This section outlines the procedures for the public to request information from the EOP, in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). For many EOP entities, it directs them to follow the FOIA procedures of the Office of Management and Budget.\n*   **Part 102 - Enforcement of Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Handicap:** These regulations detail the procedures for ensuring nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities conducted by the EOP.\n\n**Recent Major Changes**\n\nWhile the codified sections of Title 3 (Parts 100-102) have not undergone major revisions recently, with the last amendment noted in 2015, the nature of Title 3 means that \"major changes\" are constantly occurring through the issuance of new presidential documents.\n\nRecent presidential actions that represent significant changes include a variety of executive orders, proclamations, and notices. For instance, as of November 2025, recent presidential documents have included:\n*   A notice continuing a national emergency concerning the situation in Nicaragua.\n*   A proclamation for National Adoption Month, 2025.\n*   Executive Order 14359, \"Fostering the Future for American Children and Families.\"\n\nFurthermore, the policy direction of a new administration can bring about sweeping changes through the executive orders compiled in Title 3. For example, a change in administration can lead to the revocation of previous executive orders and the issuance of new ones with wide-ranging regulatory impact.\n\nIt is important to note that the annual publication of Title 3 serves as a snapshot in time. For the most current information on presidential actions, the daily Federal Register is the most up-to-date source. The electronic CFR (e-CFR) is also continuously updated, providing a more current, though unofficial, version of the regulations."}],"role":"model"},"finishReason":"STOP","groundingMetadata":{"groundingChunks":[{"chunkMetadata":{"query":"what are presidential documents in 3
